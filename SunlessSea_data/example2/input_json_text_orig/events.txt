Through the glass now I could see what lay at the meeting-point of its faces: thousands upon thousands of spider-eyes, champing spider-fangs, fused together like wax.

>>	Description	They are numerous, but lost to wine and music. You will have the element of surprise, but it's very hard to know exactly what those weapons will do.
>>>	Description	The privateers run, yell, and fall! But now one seizes a weapon like a trombone inscribed with blasphemies. It conjures an appalling vibration which converts your zailors to screaming jellies. Another crouches behind a rock: she employs a kind of mortar which rains down lethal pine-cones. They smell delightful, but their perfume causes pine-needles to erupt in green masses from your ears, mouths and necks. Your crew is lost to bewildered terror: you flee as the triumphant privateers celebrate amid flares of red light.

The battle is over before it's begun, but by the time it's safe to approach, the sparks have devoured many of the privateers' treasures...

You can make out words here and there - "liver" - "thunder" - "expunge" - "consume" - but it's hard to resolve them into sense. The longer you listen, the less sense it makes, until you begin to fear what effect their infernal whispering is having. When your bo'sun turns to whisper to you, and you hear only the bleating of a goat, you realise it's time to retreat...

You creep away before anything worse can happen. But this is an odd and useful miscellany of facts.

They set up on a dark beach lit by torches on poles, and do eight folk-songs, a mischievous music-hall number called The Empress Likes Them Quiet, and an odd restless little tune like a caged cat. "My own composition," the Washman confides.\r\n\r\nHonestly, they're not very good. They are unrehearsed and uneven, and the presence of something serpentine in the surf puts them off. But those homely sounds here on the deep's doorstep - something about it lifts the heart.

The beasts. There must be at least two of them. Who knows how many more?\r\n\r\nYou retreat with haste to the ship, eyes wide, though you see nothing more of the predators. Perhaps their hunger is satisfied.

The fusillade almost drowns out the hoarse screeching of the creature in the shadows.\r\n\r\nWhen you drag into the light, its oily flesh is already beginning to dissolve (perhaps the light is hastening it?) Whatever it was, it had many-jointed leathery limbs, eyes like a bunch of grapes, a folding assembly of mandibles. It stinks of vinegar and mould.

You see nothing more of the beast, but your wretched crew is proving to be more of a danger anyway. Back to the ship.

Its eyes brim with primal rage. Excellent! It'll be worth an Echo or ten.

They chitter as they swarm: the sound is like pebbles on a beach. Be careful. A single blemmigan is a nuisance. A hundred are a calamity.

>>>	Description	You hush your men and watch it go. It swoops down on the mound, to the alarm of a little circle of blemmigans who stand at the top like citizens attending a public meeting. Their tentacles whip menacingly as they advance - but the cockatoo says something to give them pause. You strain your ears to hear. Fragments of screeched poetry from your pet vie with the shrill fluting of the blemmigans... are they reciting poetry too? Is this a competition? A greeting?\r\n\r\nAbruptly, your Cockatoo rises, and returns to sit on your shoulder. It preens delightedly and delivers four lines of perfect decasyllabic quatrain on 'those thousand shapes of unforgiven Time'. You have no idea what the hell it's talking about, but the delivery is terribly impressive.

You'll mourn them later.

They seethe across the bog, leaping across black gaps of standing water, maws agape! But you direct your crew's fire with calm and precision, and only a few reach the line. Your crew methodically smash them with rifle-stocks and advance with caution towards the bog. The blemmigans which remained to defend the mound are no match for your weaponry: you take the mound without a single fatality and they die, chittering curses.\r\n\r\nOf course, now you're possessed of a mound of mud. You find nothing of value, although the blemmigans apparently collected little clay tablets marked with indecipherable chicken-scratchings. Your quartermaster, however, points out that the blemmigan bodies can be rendered into purple dye, which will fetch a good price almost anywhere...

You pry one open, cracking the half-rotten wood: an immaculately dressed corpse frowns within. It tries not to stir. You open another, and another: until, one gently takes you by the wrist. "We cannot die truly here; but some of us would like to pretend. Won't you leave us in peace?" [Check your journal to be reminded of where the Last Constable might be!]

Peering through the half-rotten timber, you see them prise open the coffins laid within, and rob the pretend-dead of their jewels and silks.\r\n\r\nThat is, at least, until they gather around a black coffin, festooned with ribbons. "Cor! Look at that little treasure there on 'er finger," says one. "Come here, you - ah!" A truncheon swings out of the coffin, cracking his crown. The other two scatter, as a woman leaps out of the black coffin, like a sleeper from a nightmare, and chases them down. This must be the Constable.

With luck, the zailors waiting above with the stone will not have wandered off.\r\n\r\n"The Salt Lions," the Midnighter says breathily. "Oh yes, oh yes. That must be forgotten.

He deflects questions about the purpose of this installation - "classified, you know" - but smilingly offers you tea, biscuits and mineralogical anecdotes.\r\n\r\nThe biscuits are good, but the anecdotes rather blend one into the next.

Officers listen intently to your intelligence. And you whisper the Dread Surmise into the translucently perfect ear of the Commodore himself. (He smells like spice and sunlight.)\r\n\r\nThree days and three nights later, a procession of marines carries a cedar casket to your ship, decorated with gold leaf. You open it, very cautiously. The skull which once adorned the Eater of Names now lies within, its forehead marked with a glyph of furious power. The shape of it chatters your teeth and vibrates your vision. This will drink the danger of the sunlight. Who knows what else it might do? But it will suffice. It will permit you to colonise Aestival.

>>>	Description	Only a few minutes later, you glance back, and the Navigator is gone. You climb the steps to examine the spot where you saw him last. His coat lies in the snow.

>>>	Description	He didn't exaggerate. The ice is slick as an oiled mirror. You need pitons and spiked boots to navigate the slopes, and a misplaced foot will send great chunks of it thundering into the thirsty sea. The air bites like a bound shark. Your face is numb, your fingers stiff, your throat raw. The climb takes you around a sheer white cliff, the waters below swimming with shards of razored ice.\r\n\r\nAt last, a frozen ledge. A vertical sheet of ice rises before you, reflective as a conjurer's glass. Engraved upon it, twenty feet high, is the Navigator's sigil. "Impressive, isn't it?" the researcher says, dropping his pack. "It's one of the old accords between Whither and Irem. It means <i>Almost Never Remembered</i>."\r\n\r\nYour Navigator approaches it warily. The sigil on his temple sparks with blue fire. He reaches out, his fingers touching those of his reflection in the ice - and his reflection lunges forward, whispering something in his ear. The Navigator crumples into the snow. "Oh." The Plucky Researcher says. "Damn. We're going to have a devil of a time getting him back to the ship." You do. But you manage it.\r\n\r\nBack in your cosy cabin you imbibe mulled rum.

This one could be a crenellated castle: that one, a horse's head.\r\n\r\n A neat little port huddles into the side of a coral island - prosaic Imperial docks and houses tucked away in a baroque organic chaos. In that curious silvery light, among the frozen chaos of coral, the scene has the unreal air of a pencil sketch, crumpled and discarded.

The pearly glow of the coral throbs from a seam along its shoulder, its arm - pulses in its face-fronds. "Otharooth," it pipes, cheerfully. It hands you a page of notes smeared with tangerine goo. Can Rubbery Men write? The hand is elegant and disciplined - times and dates precisely recorded.

Sometimes, they speak of things far away: the Khanate's work, the smuggler wars, the Fathomking's secrets. Perhaps it's not all invented...

So you're looking for loose fragments. Today the zee is calm, and you find a good few candidates. They lie shining softly like droplets of moon.\r\n\r\nBut after a little while, you become concerned that they're eyes: that each is watching you. When you close your fist around one, it examines your blood with amused delight. When you put them together in your pocket, they clatter and gossip together. Of course, you think. They broke from the Shining Mind: they have its vitality, but not its weariness or experience. You will have to lock them in a separate boxes, lest they peep at you when you're bathing, and see who you are. The thought of their sight on your skin fills you with horror. What if your skin turned clear? What if they saw your bones?\r\n\r\nYou come back to yourself when you see one of your zailors fall on his back and start kicking delightedly in the air like a beetle. "Gravity!" he cries. "I have fallen!" You hasten back to the ship with your haul of coral, before it can do any further damage.

You edge along the slippery coral, picking up lumps of brighter-glowing stuff here and there: and though the zee doesn't stain, eventually it begins to whisper to you: phrases so clear that you catch yourself looking over your shoulder in case your crew have spoke. They have not. They're looking around, just as you are.\r\n\r\n<i>Between stars,</i> the zee says. <i>Descend the chain.</i> When it runs out across the coral, it sounds almost like a soft chuckle. <i>I rest here,</i> it tells you. <i>I forget.</i>

The Roots that pin the corner of the board down, to keep you safe from your opponent. You lift a Paw to toy with it: touch its velvety pads.\r\n\r\n"Checkmate," your opponent says. She grins. "Look too closely, did we? You need to be careful with scintillack chess-sets."\r\n\r\nHer face is blank and white as the dome of a chess-pawn. Get out. Get back to the ship, until the waking-dream of the coral clears.

>>>	Description	You don't know how long you've been playing. You won a match, another. The rough coral tips of the chess-pieces are smeared with blood: yours, your opponent's. But you have begun to realise that your moves recapitulate the movements of the powers of the Neath: the Flukes and their shapelings. The Bazaar that lurks in London. Mt Nomad, that prowls the sea. Salt, Stone, Storm. With every move you take, the shape of it becomes clearer in your mind, sharper.\r\n\r\n"Checkmate," you say. One more game? Your first officer is tugging at your arm.

An explosion blasts the door from its hinges; it falls between you both. You peek into the room. The bodies are scattered like chess pieces from an upturned board.

The bergamot-pomegranate curd on toast. The commerce in rat-corpses. The hatred of cats. The absolute custom against ever issuing a paper invitation for any event no matter how formal. \r\n\r\nIt's the familiarity, the not-quite-London-ness of the place that makes it all so... odd.

High above, you hear an answering buzz.\r\n\r\nWhere she indicated roses, you find a cache of fuel buried beneath the bones of sacrifices. Where she spoke of drums, you find Khanate religious treasures beneath a stone - world-stones, ivory cups, a hand-drum of shell. \r\n\r\nThe zailors carry her corpse back to the ship.

Sometimes they must saw a piece in half, or abrade its sides to make it fit, but the work proceeds with surprising speed. The Impeller begins to take shape - a squat, heavy-shouldered shape, like a scarecrow built to resemble an engine.\r\n\r\n"I don't think this is engineering any more," the Mechanic confides. "Possibly it's witchcraft. But I don't really mind." He rubs his hands.
>>>	Description	Now the Mechanic wraps ivory segments with wire and scalds them with acid. He stains them with blood. ("I'll need some of yours, too," he says apologetically. "You're the captain.") He studs the bones with sapphires. He has the sailors bring up his last two custom-made components: an assemblage of copper tubes (in which he places the Element of Dawn) and a steel capsule the size of a barrel (which he has the zailors lock into the Impeller's black bone core).\r\n\r\n"Almost ready," he affirms."It just needs a spark, and a heart." He looks to the Unsettling Sage.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," the Sage says, a little sadly. "The heart is destiny's engine." He climbs into the capsule at the Impeller's heart, and locks the framework into place behind him. The Mechanic strikes the tubes which contain the Element, and it spits forth a sizzle of rosy light. The ivory blazes instantly with energy! The capsule, instantly incandescent with heat, seals shut forever. With a ticking sound, it slowly begins to cool.\r\n\r\nThe Impeller stands radiant and whole before you: a jigsaw of heatlessly blazing ivory, with a martyr at its core. "What a relief!" the Mechanic says. "I wasn't entirely sure that would work." He claps you on the shoulder. "My work is done. Thank you. Thank you!"

"Thank you, [q:Addressed As]. I am at home." The thing that follows you back to your ship is not the Navigator. But it has his skills, and his face (though the right half is blotted by the sprawling sigil). The crew edge away.

Only the binoculars remain as they were, untouched and untransmuted.\r\n\r\nYou pick them up and look to the East. Past the Deconstruction, where the known zee ends and the legends begin. Somewhere, in the deepest distance, a light flickers. You hear the splashing of a distant wake, getting closer. But it is gone as fast as any other passing fancy.

We had help: a London captain." He pauses, listening. You hear nothing, but the Gallivant smiles. "Oh, that is very just. Is there anything -? Yes. Yes. I will anticipate them. I'll -"\r\n\r\nThe Gallivant blinks, and laughs. He grins at you, his tongue cleaning the red from his teeth. "My master is a man guided by his principles: liberty, equality, eternity.

Phosphorescent cliff-clingers gawp as the zee sinks. Monster-bones rise from the murk. The ship tilts violently sideways, with a sound like a reef's jaw closing. The zee, the zee! It rises, black-fisted, and falls on you with all its weight.\r\n\r\nYou cling desperately to the helm. The waters drain away. Zailors lie coughing, or flopping like fish. Zeeweed drapes the railings. Around the ship, the lights of Wolfstack docks.

You don't follow all the details of the plot, but somehow the pig ends up in an attic and the butler in a vicar's bed. Candles flicker, dishes enter and leave, and the wind butts gently at the window-panes. By the time the plum-pudding arrives, you're as cheerful as you've been in months.

She beats time on the table as she speaks, as if to a song only she can hear. The effect is hypnotic.\r\n\r\nYour attention drifts, out through the skylight of the dining room, to the false-stars glittering in the roof of the cavern. You drift like a puffball-spore. The Unterzee shimmers below. Islands lie like mineral specimens on black velvet. Ships bob like wood-chips between the islands. Vast spined things pulse in the depths. There is a scent like the scent before a storm...\r\n\r\n"The storm came," says Phoebe quietly. "Everything changed." Somewhere in there, you finished the last course. The scowling maid reluctantly serves cheese and Bath Oliver biscuits.

>>>	Description	The sisters listen with delight to your stories, and unlock the cellar door for you. The key is so heavy that Cynthia can only lift it with both hands. "We won't go in," she says. "We don't go in."\r\n\r\nThe signs on the stones have a Khaganian look. In the deepest sub-cellar, your candles illuminate a litter of tumbled stones - the remnants of a temple. The pool at the cellar's centre is almost dry. The remaining water there seethes oddly in the candle-light, as if it were near boiling, but it's quite cool to the touch.\r\n\r\n"The Writhing River flows near here," the Mechanic remarks. "One of the tributaries of dream. (I hope it doesn't touch the well those poor girls drink from.) My enemies find me when I sleep - but this water will attract my enemies to this poor fellow."\r\n\r\nHe bends to dip his hand in the water and sketches a sign on the Clay Man's forehead. The Man watches him stolidly. The Mechanic hands him the Mirrorcatch Box. "Hold this," he says. "Keep it open. Don't let go, no matter what happens." The Clay Man's huge hands enfold the box.\r\n\r\n"There," the Mechanic says, turning to you. "A serpent-trap. Now, I can sleep. I can finally sleep." He smiles. "And then I think I may be able to offer you something rather interesting." [Speak to the Mechanic on board ship to advance the story further.]

A third sits by the fireplace, staring sorrowfully into the embers.\r\n\r\nA log pops, and the woman by the fire gives a violent start. You cannot restrain a start of your own, and her eyes meet yours through the glass. She claps her hand to her mouth in shock. There is nothing to do but step apologetically into the room.\r\n\r\n "A visitor!" the pianist - the youngest - cries. The next youngest chuckles. The eldest, who you frightened, sighs.

>>>	Description	You don't know the cliff paths like the locals do, and you have to climb more than walk. Your skin is sheened with sweat by the time you reach the top. They've started without you. How rude.\r\n\r\nAn elderly fellow wears a feathered head-dress and not much else: he seems to be leading the ceremony. One assistant holds an ear of corn (where did he find that down here?), another a stone jug, another a clay tablet. The elderly priest addresses them all to his congregation.\r\n\r\nYou catch snatches of it: "The Drowned Man is not a god." (The villagers hiss a reply.) "He came from the North, and to the North he will return." (Another reply.) "The North is too cold for gods." ("Too cold for gods," they intone delightedly.)\r\n\r\nFinally, they nod in agreement. The circle turns as one to grab one of their number, a man (or woman?) with a lamp. They carry him (or possibly her) to the precipice and hurl the flailing body over the edge, down into the oily black waves far below.\r\n\r\nTheir business done, the locals remove their robes and wander amiably back to town. They all seem quite jolly. Apparently the night's business went well. They retreat to the Cock and Magpie for a pint.

The birth-cries are everywhere heard, as Clay Men sit up, opening incurious eyes, awaiting their tithing to London.\r\n\r\nThe Clay Broker waits on the quayside.

Perhaps not so happy, you say...\r\n\r\nBy the end of your story, the captain and his zailors are all groaning in unison with the rest of Polythreme. Nevertheless, after he blows his nose into a demoralised handkerchief, he conveys his thanks, and passes you a small - but exceedingly noisy - reward. It should quiet once you leave the isle.

THEN, FAR FROM LAND, THEY TOOK AXES THEIR SHIPS, SANK THEM, AND FOLLOWED THEM - MAN, WOMAN, CHILD - INTO THE DEPTHS.

At last he leads you into the heart of Wisdom, through five gates with locks of brass and iron, to the Governor's office.\r\n\r\nThe Governor sits rigid in a high-backed chair.

You've seen his scarred face elsewhere - Polythreme has a high bounty on his head, after he captured their vessels long ago, and led them to their doom in some forgotten escapade. The Governor roars, and pulls a pistol from beneath his desk; before he can fire, you relate the Sprightly Visionary's orders. He stands, knocking over his high-back chair. "I will begin gathering my men at once!" He bows deeply.

One crew-member does, in fact, fall out of the pipe on his return, straight into the mouth of a knot-oracle. It munches him ruminatively while his twitching leg protrudes - rather like a farmer chewing an interesting straw. Unpleasant.\r\n\r\nStill, all things considered, it went rather well.

The tea is hot and nutty and rather pleasant. She asks about your voyages: she is desperate for news of London, of its mists, its nights, its sick, its poor, its fires... She tactfully turns aside questions about the Convention, but she shares some of the secrets of the Neath.\r\n\r\n"Come and see me again," she says. "Next time you're here." She shrugs gracefully.

She stares at them for a long moment, and then tears begin to roll silently down her face. "Thank you," she says. "I've missed them so." (One of her tears lands on the wood of the crate, which begins to smoke.)\r\n\r\n"Let me tell you something very special." (She whispers it in your ear: her breath smells like hot stone.)

I would so love to get away from this ghastly little rock, back to where the souls glow and the dances never end…"\r\n\r\n"So listen. I have something more valuable for them.

It'll be one of your human reasons. Compunction or compassion or one of those. What an untidy race you are."\r\n\r\nShe sighs. "Well, I owe you a double debt, don't I? You have done me both an ill turn and a good one. Here is an ill turn and a good turn for you. Goodbye. We won't see each other again."\r\n\r\nShe unlocks the ebony tallboy at the back of the room and hands you a mother-of-pearl music box. It plays a tinkling, dissonant tune that calls to mind something caged and wretched. All the way back to the ship, that tune tinkles in your thoughts, unlocking peculiar unhuman thoughts.

Silent, deserted; reserved only for you. Beyond them are houses centuries older, all abandoned.\r\n\r\nA playful current tugs at you. A familiar voice. You open your window, and allow the current to carry you to Lady Black's colonnaded palace. Perhaps today, her Ladyship will desire conversation, or a swim through her glowing gardens.

You give him your blessing to make use of anything he sees, if he truly believes it will achieve something worthwhile.\r\n\r\nHe looks up.

She has noticed, perhaps for the first time, that there are no boxes.\r\n\r\n"Deliveries come all the way up here," she says, before singing again.\r\n\r\nYou indicate that your crew is unaccustomed to that sort of work.\r\n\r\nShe looks as exasperated as a person can while continuing to sing about rabbit's feet and edible emeralds, but at last she says she'll see to it, if you can lead her servants to the correct landing.

But just when you think your pick is about to snap, the lock gives way.\r\n\r\nNot that it does you any good. The warehouse is so full already that when you open the door, a box falls out, glass shattering within. Pale silver liquid leaks around your feet and runs in rivulets over the stone of the path. A moment later it sets up, hard and cold as frost. \r\n\r\nSOOTHE & COOPER EXPORTS, says the stenciling on the boxes.

You and the crew have to stop seven or eight times to set down the boxes and blow on your hands.\r\n\r\nThe closer you get, the less the building with the spire looks like a church. The walls are soot-blackened and made of brick. There are no windows, only narrow vents up near the roof. From these a low singing can be heard, a song so cheerful that your crew look at one another and frown. It is the song of someone keeping the monsters at bay.\r\n\r\nAt last you are close enough to bang on the door. \r\n\r\nAn Austere Acolyte answers it. She is dressed in black from head to foot. Her gloves are thick leather and her goggles are double glass.\r\n\r\n"Leave the boxes at the door," she says to you, and then she turns back toward the building, singing her song. Something about candied kittens and flaming violets and the coming of spring. Judging by the rhyme, she's inventing the words as she goes along.\r\n\r\nYou stop her and explain that you expect your extra work to be rewarded. She makes a grudging gesture, but complies.

In another corner of the room is a pile of wood from previous boxes already emptied and dismantled.\r\n\r\nSinging to herself about a mountain upholstered in velvet, she takes a crowbar to the box.\r\n\r\nThe corpse inside is permanently dead, in a way that the dead of London often are not. Not a drownie, not a tomb colonist, but not coming back, either. It looks pale and ordinary except for the slight distention of the skin over the breastbone. Gently the Acolyte presses there and nods (singing about tulips embroidered with yellow floss). \r\n\r\nShe lifts the body onto a marble slab. Without pause in her lyrics she prepares a scalpel. Your presence does not seem to bother her.

>>>	Description	The Austere Acolyte makes an incision over the distended place on the body, laying bare a heart-sized sphere of silver metal. It has grown there, apparently over many years, because the ribs of the corpse have curved around it without cracking. She has to break two of the ribs now to take out the ball. Behind it, the heart is intact but bloodless, its colour a milky grey.\r\n\r\nShe notices you watching, and halts her song just long enough to say, "They do not always grow in the same place, but over the heart is most common."\r\n\r\nWith a giant nutcracker, she cracks the sphere, and another sphere inside that, and another.\r\n\r\nFinally in the center she comes to something heavy, small, and black.

"It's such a flawless secret. You rarely see one of such high quality. He'd come to the unshakeable intellectual conviction that souls are only a kind of gaseous vapour. He didn't dare tell anyone for fear of losing his position, but he had too much integrity of mind to stop believing it merely because of the inconvenience. \r\n\r\n"Shame it's not the sort of thing the Masters are looking for."

>>>	Description	When the Austere Acolyte pulls the corpse's hands away from her chest, you see: the nodules grow in both palms, flattened ovals under the skin.\r\n\r\nThe Acolyte's big nutcracker struggles to get any purchase on these, dense and narrow as they are, but she manages in the end. She is singing about a beach of sugar sand, and an ocean of caramel.\r\n\r\nShe spends a long time with the goggles, and the song goes quiet then. \r\n\r\nWith a sigh the Acolyte throws the secrets aside. "She wanted to kill her sister's husband. She didn't commit the murder, but her hands itched to push him from the balcony of their townhouse."\r\n\r\nEven from here you sense the breathtaking hatred, as involuntary as lust. The precision of the murderous fantasies. Surprise, because she was not accustomed to such feelings. Fear at learning she was capable of them. Self-justification that such feelings were deserved. Heady excitement at having any emotion that ran so strong. Then hate again—\r\n\r\n"Your pony is made of fresh baked bread," sings the Acolyte in your ear. You're back in your body. You find yourself standing very close to the noxious black pellet, as though you were about to scoop it up and eat it.\r\n\r\n"...and butter is its saddle," she sings soothingly, leading you away to the far side of the room. There you sit until she has disposed of the thing, which is of no use to anyone.

How her baby brother died on the road. How she came to another country, and married, and never told her children or her grandchildren what she had seen, because she did not want to poison them with grief.\r\n\r\nNot a story for the Masters, but more steel than you've ever seen in one body before.

>>>	Description	The smithy is a long low building that you missed on your first survey of the island. The blacksmith works, it proves, entirely in heart-metal, though it is so hard and cruel that it wears his tools out quickly.\r\n\r\n"Nothing like it for weaponry," he says. "Does more damage than any ordinary steel, and a little bit of the shrapnel will give you trouble to the end of your days."

You try singing it with various invented lyrics about a kite made of pantaloons and a clock that can only strike thirteen. The tune holds up, and you're sure that the Austere Acolyte's broader and more varied verses will go with it just as well.\r\n\r\nWhen you whistle it for her, she seems really quite touched.

You quickly learn better than to touch it, or even go very near it. The cumulative misery of so many lives is dizzying if you even look in the general direction. You keep your eyes out to sea instead.

Looking too far away from it makes you a poor watchman. It makes for an uncomfortable couple of hours, pacing around the dumping ground, which runs all the way down to the beach.\r\n\r\nIn the last quarter of the watch, there's stealthy movement, a rowboat, three hooded figures.

The convulsions that brought them up will soon take them below again.

>>>	Description	You and your crew swarm over the ambery stuff with hammers and chisels, smashing off hunks and chunks. It powders easily (emitting an unexpected lemony fragrance) and the rising sea washes quantities of it away - but you fill pockets and sacks with it. At last a rumble rises from below - the amber shudders - and you all scramble clear as it sinks back into the deep. The waters close over it with a tremendous roar and show of foam.

>>	Description	The amber encasing the ancient stones has cracked under the grinding pressures of the earth. You could scramble in and examine them.
>>>	Description	You squeeze through the fissures in the amber shell to explore the ruins within. The dwellings are low and windowless - thick-walled, flat-roofed - like those in desert countries. Nothing like anything in the Neath. You find shattered pots, glass beads, and bones, all mired in amber.\r\n\r\nAmong the rest you find a shining black haematite ornament the size of two fists: a bulbous thing, graven with concentric circles. Stubby protrusions, crudely worked, hang below like wax driblets. You realise, as you turn it in your hand, what it looks like: one of the domes of the great Echo Bazaar in London.\r\n\r\n"Something wrong about these bones - " one of your zailors mutters uneasily, a seasoned woman with a little surgeon's training. She's right. The shape of the skull is not precisely human: the arms-bones have splayed out like twigs off a branch. Another exclaims as he finds the bones of a small animal, coiled together like a knot of serpents. \r\n\r\n"Shapelings!" someone hisses - you think that's what they say - but none of your crew will admit to speaking.\r\n\r\nThere's a rumbling from below. You all scramble desperately for the exits in the amber casing, squeezing through one by one, just in time. The amber snaps shut and the ruins sink again beneath the waves with a tremendous roar and show of foam. You still have the haematite sculpture in your hand...

You scramble clear, but the amber snaps shut like a clam as you scramble clear, catching a zailor from Spite by the ankle. She screams a thin, tearing, desperate scream and struggles to free herself: in vain. The waters close over the ruin as it sinks, and the screaming ends abruptly.

Very senior indeed. She wants to come home, eh?

He bows; she bows; they chatter together in one of Hell's hissing, clicking languages, and laugh at a shared joke.\r\n\r\nFor a moment you seem forgotten, but she turns back. To thank you? No: to pay you. "All shall be well, now," she says gleefully, "and all manner of thing shall be well. You've done a terrible thing, and I am terribly grateful. Take this."\r\n\r\n"This" is a smouldering ruby from the throat of Mt Palmerston. It is scorching hot from her touch. She chuckles fondly as you juggle it hastily from hand to hand.

Satisfaction? Admiration? Something of those, and another emotion, a hot flat reptilian one that only devils understand. "Goodbye," is all she says. The goat-demons guide her down a flight of iron steps, to the basement entrance of the Excruciation Annex.\r\n\r\nThe Urbane Devil lounges by one of the Embassy's ornamental lamps, picking his teeth with a splinter of purplish crystal. "Bravo! And that concludes our business. Here." He hands you a flat parcel wrapped in coppery crêpe paper, and bounds off, whistling.\r\n\r\nThe parcel contains a beautifully rendered oil-painting of the Deviless, in a gown with a ruffled collar which suggests the sixteenth century. Her eyes are closed.

She's saying something about the old days -\r\n\r\n"... we built our hives on the edge of dream," she slurs, "while men were monkeys still. Monkey-souls are poor unripe things - like this wine of yours - but they serve as consolation. I require consolation, [q:Addressed As]. I do."\r\n\r\nShe looks directly into your eyes. "You're very pretty," she says. Then she falls face-down in the remains of her chops and stewed mushrooms, and begins to snore.

It forms around the thing you don't want to say, and holds it in."\r\n\r\nFrom there her explanation becomes more iatrotheological in nature. There's something about the reaction of souls with a compound of silence and grief, and something about the circulation of the blood. She appears to believe these points explain why the metal sets hard, and why it takes different shapes in different bodies, and why some users find it necessary to keep drinking tonic all their lives until the balls have grown as large as organs.

"The Memento Mori!"\r\n\r\nThe grin dissipates. "It's... finished. I'm not sure what to do now." [Mount the Memento Mori on your ship, or sell it to one of the warlike zee-nations.

As though you were the one who did not want to see the Acolyte hurt.\r\n\r\nThe Acolyte weeps gratefully.

The remaining water there seethes oddly in the candle-light, as if it were near boiling, but it's quite cool to the touch.\r\n\r\n"The Writhing River flows near here," the Mechanic remarks. "One of the tributaries of dream. My enemies find me when I sleep - but this water will attract my enemies to this poor fellow."\r\n\r\nHe bends to dip his hand in the water and sketches a sign on the Clay Man's forehead. The Man watches him stolidly. The Mechanic hands him the Mirrorcatch Box. "Hold this," he says. "Keep it open. Don't let go, no matter what happens." The Clay Man's huge hands enfold the box.\r\n\r\n"There," the Mechanic says, turning to you. "A serpent-trap. Now, I can sleep. I can finally sleep." He smiles.

Her mocking laugh answers you even before her words do: "Yes, it would be terrible indeed, Taamas. And before you ask," she adds. "No, I do not have any desire to leave Varchas. The rest of Neath has fallen from Mihir's grace, and I have no wish to join them!"

How's the food?"\r\n\r\nThe Visionary writes a message in the notebook chained to his wrist. He presents it to you both: '<i>Welcome. Sorry, must run. You need to register yourself - go straight ahead. Advice: no questions. Befriend Temtum. Good day.</i>'

Eventually you pass through an iron gate to a work room.\r\n\r\nAt the room's centre is a deep pit. A large electrical alternator looms against the back wall. The Visionary plugs the cable into the alternator, and slowly feeds the rest down into the pit. When finished, he writes a short message in the notebook chained to his wrist. '<i>Thank you. Usual help's working on faulty line. May need you in future.</i>' As he hands you the note he looks up, revealing his neck. It's one huge scar.

Some people exchange shrugs; others twiddle their thumbs politely. Eventually, the Impolite Investigator appears on a balcony overlooking the square. He shouts a hello; the dwellers wince, but maintain their customary smiles. \r\n\r\n"Hideaway," he shouts, "is doomed. This is a biological fact. Temtum has already begun to outgrow his shell, our home. Everyone needs to evacuate, before..." He gives you a nod: you set the model ablaze, and it begins to crack apart and fall to ruin. The dwellers scream. \r\n\r\nThe Sprightly Visionary turns his back on the spectacle and walks away. He taps a few cablemen on the shoulder; they follow him. The rest of the people of Hideaway stands idly, watching the wooden city crack and burn.

>>	Description	The fire is lit. The smoke of printed love-stories rises into the dark. The Sisters chant in a language older than London. They play a wistful, halting music on harps and lyres. The Adventuress has had her uniform ironed. Even her buttons are polished. Her knife is ready in her left hand, and her pistol in her right. Far above, in the deep night of the Neath, something briefly occludes the light of the false-stars.\r\n\r\n"Go back to the ship," she says abruptly. "I don't want you to see me die. Please."
>>>	Description	From the deck, you see the light of the fire turn ice-blue, roar to greater brightness, and fail as night falls from the roof. A shot. Another. Shrieks, like the tearing of sheet metal, like the fission of thought. A terrible silence. One final, furious shriek! The glass in the bridge windows cracks like ice. Abbey Rock is silent.\r\n\r\nThe Prioress arrives a half-hour later. Her eyes are shining. "She scarred it," she says delightedly. "Oh, how she scarred it! We'll lay her to rest in our own crypt. We'll write her name on our wall. The next novice who joins us will be named for her. She scarred it! Thank you. And she wanted you to have this."\r\n\r\nIt's her pistol, silver-chased, drenched in black and stinging blood.

"I once swore," she remarks, "to kill nothing that flies. I hope I break that oath." They will be her last words.\r\n\r\nA piece of star-specked night falls shrieking from the roof! The bonfire is quenched in an instant, but a gout of flame from the pistol punctures the dark: once, again. The night is screaming now, deep rending cries that are almost words. The scent of ice and ozone is overpowering. You reach out a hand, blindly. The darkness deepens, but a Sister takes hold of your shoulder. "Stay away!" she hisses.\r\n\r\nThe Adventuress cries out. So does the night. This last shriek squeezes your skull and rakes your brain and tears the words from your throat. It cracks the cobblestones of the Abbey yard. In the flames of a final shot, you glimpse a crested wave of night rearing above the Adventuress. Its wings are the sky. Its horns and vanes blaze with scars. It strikes - it convulses - it whirls, and it's gone. Your eyes are hazed with frost, but as it rises - you are quite certain - it lurches to the side, as if one of its wings had suffered a blow...\r\n\r\nOn the cracked cobbles at your feet lies the Adventuress, dead eyes staring. Beside her lies her pistol, silver-chased, drenched in black blood. As you watch, the blood wisps in choking vapour from the metal, leaving it stained dark as the zee.

>>>	Description	In the first panel, Mihir is depicted as the sun, beaming rays of thinly hammered gold onto a Surface city both peaceful and prosperous. The Five Towers are carved with loving detail, barely recognisable without the wreaths of fungal-flowers and curling vines. In the next panel Mihir blinks, and the city turns to shards of onyx and jet, slowly crumbling away.\r\n\r\nMihir then becomes a broad-shouldered, sorrow-faced man stalking the false-starred blackness of the Neath in search of his lost city. His eyes are picked out in orange-red carnelian, and seem lit with inner fire. \r\n\r\nVarchas as-it-is-now is conspiciously absent from the carvings, as if the Stone-Carvers could not bear to chip its Fallen outlines.

He asks, and you know better than to mutter anything but meaningless platitudes in response. He nods as though satisfied but you catch him giving you sharp, speculative looks as you wander the Temple. It seems you have aroused his interest.

"You cannot undermine a <i>heard</i> text with mantras from a <i>remembered</i> one!"\r\n\r\nApparently the difference is this: 'heard' texts were cosmic truths whispered by Mihir himself to the ancient sages. 'Remembered' texts do not claim such illustrious origins, and are merely passed-down wisdom. \r\n\r\nThe difference might seem trivial to you, but apparently this is a subject of heated theological debate. A few of the other patrons look on indulgently, and offer bits of scripture or shouted exhortation.

Tending the Mirror-Mad uses up almost as much fuel as Mihir's temple, because they can only be lit with direct lamp-light. We don't dare let them near any mirrors." \r\n\r\nShe shudders again.

"Which is why most of these malingerers are Guards."\r\n\r\nThe patient nearest to her pretends to swoon. "But what would I do, away from your gentle, tender gaze, O Fair Nurse?" He clasps his hands to his bosom.

Musicians play stirring tunes on polished brass-instruments and little calabash-lyres, all undercut with the rhythmic sound of drums.\r\n\r\nA towering machine piled high with fungus is wheeled to the front of the procession. The drivers sit in a lamp-lit cabin at the front, their faces grim. The Agnihotri raises his hand, and a hush falls over all of Varchas.\r\n\r\nThe Mirrored Gates slide open, rays of light reflecting jaggedly. Outside, the Elder Continent is dark and hushed and vast. You have the dizzying feeling that it is vaster and onyx-blacker than the Unterzee, somehow, but that cannot be.

"We deny the tyranny of Mihir and his Priests and his high-born Fire-Keepers! We refuse to isolate ourselves from the rest of the Neath any longer! We refuse to fear the dark, and cower in the light!" His voice raises to a roar. "WE ARE FALLEN!"\r\n\r\nThe Neathers shout their enthusiasm, and hold up their mirror-shards like banners.

A sussuration goes through the crowd as the Sun-Priest holds up a shard of broken mirror. \r\n\r\n"They are in thrall to the Parabolan powers who whisper through mirrors and entice through dreams and trickery. They are breaking the mirrors and dousing the lamps."\r\n\r\nIf they are <i>breaking</i> mirrors, you point out, how then can they be in league with mirror-lords?\r\n\r\nThe Sun-Priest gives you a pitying look. "Oh, Taamas. What happens when you break a mirror?" He snaps the shard he is holding, and holds the broken pieces in either hand. They glint jaggedly. "You simply <i>make more mirrors</i>."\r\n\r\nPerhaps he is telling the truth. Or perhaps he merely fears the Neathers, and their desire to curtail the power of the Temple to which he is sworn.

They douse lamp after lamp until they create a perfect circle of darkness bounded by their joined hands.\r\n\r\nOne by one, the Sun Priests throw the revolutionaries into the shadow.

Beneath, in more recent and less careful letters, he has added a note: <i>You did not answer. If I cannot be forgiven, then I will forget.

One story, about the formulation of a plan that exploded a city block, featured a relentless coffee motif. "It's an attack on art," the Apprentice jokes, sheepishly. One story revolves around a failed plot in London; another focuses on the desperate escape afterward, made possible by a mysterious patron. The whole collection of work, while stilted, is violently aligned to the anarchic cause, and remarkably detailed.

The Master of the Dance tries to rally the revellers against you. He doesn't even remove the ribbon from his mouth as he approaches. But no one else joins him. Those who haven't abandoned the dance hall just stand watching the ribbon unspool.

>>>	Description	The Visionary's maps of the city are pinned to the wall behind him. Instead of planning the city's electrical grid, they now present lines of battle. The Visionary, wearing the tattered patch of a white-and-gold fish over his heart, details his plan of attack to you and your brigade.\r\n\r\nYour group surrounds the Investigator's band, then attacks. The skins of makeshift-drums are kicked in. A violin is shattered against a wall. A trumpeter flee with their rusty instrument, but are cornered in an alley. Once the scuffle is over, the Silent Reel continues in perfect quiet. The Investigator is stopped, at least for tonight.

>>>	Description	Perhaps you cannot get past the guards to see the Suggester personally. But you can shout.\r\n\r\nAs the festival commences, the Suggester looks dully into the crowd. The Suggester scarcely draws breath. And when they sign the topic of today's reflection  - "broken city-shells" - an unprecedented murmur breaks out among the dwellers. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, the people still gather materials and begin work - they have become accustomed to focusing their thoughts through artistry. Some handle the sharp spines carelessly, catching their skin. A few craft Temtum without his city-shell, and douse him with tears. When the time comes for them to describe their pieces, most merely chuck their offering down the pit without ceremony.

When the Investigator's compatriots later return in force, more physical means are required; they're sent away bloodied.\r\n\r\nThe festival proceeds like all others before it. The Suggestion is that the people should reflect on Temtum's friendship. The offerings are intensely thoughtful, and the explanation of the offerings are unusually long. The Slow-Blinking Vendor performs the sign of togetherness over and over again, until she's shaking with tears and must be led away.

>>>	Description	You lead the Impolite Investigator's followers to a building behind an iron gate. Though your force is not strong enough to break past the contingents set up by the Visionary, it is sizeable enough to distract them. As they fight, you clamber over the gate, and climb up the cracks in the building to enter through an open window. Inside the Sprightly Visionary consults a map on his wall, leaving unattended a brass panel of switches and gauges. You smash it with a wrench, and leap back out the window.\r\n\r\nBut when you land, there is rumbling - screaming from the festival square. Everyone runs to the violence. Even the Visionary leaves his centre, and dashes to the scene.

>>>	Description	Though weapons are banned throughout Hideaway, the teeth and spines you provide ensure the battle is bloody. After being sent away from the alternator, the remnants of the Investigator's group converge on a building behind an iron gate. Their bodies are bruised, and they are bleeding. It is easy to repel them, and many of the Visionary's forces enjoy the sport of beating the fellow dwellers. It is also a distraction: the Investigator is attempting to scale the building. You pull him away from the window - he only stares at you, as the lights begin to cycle through their colours like a kaleidoscope. But then there is rumbling - screaming from the festival square. Everyone runs to the violence. Even the Visionary leaves his centre, and waves you to follow him.

But still, the labour must have been staggering. The story goes that the Masters of the Bazaar lent their arts and allies to the task, but the Surface nations play down the fact. Certainly, some of the tunnels look blasted or tunneled, others look... dissolved? "Stone pigs," a stoker whispers. "Stone pigs."

>>>	Description	An inscription on the altar reads SO ARE WEE SHAPEDE. The stonecraft is perfect, but the spelling seems eccentric. Two stone knives rest on its surface, along with a chunk of flint that might be a knife, a tool or simply a lump of rock.\r\n\r\nThree human skulls wait in a niche at the back.

>>	Description	Here - in the floor, because of the stalactite's fall - is a gate of glittering chalcedony, half-lost beneath rubble but thick enough to resist the most determined assault. Its surface is a relief of twisted limbs, distorted faces screaming in glee. (Carved? Moulded? Impossibly, natural?) A pit at its centre might be a key-socket, or only a mouth.
>>>	Description	Perhaps, once, the gate was finely counter-balanced. Perhaps, once, hidden machineries would have roared at the touch of the Eolith, and the gate would have swung open like oiled glass. Now, the Eolith only triggers the unlocking mechanism. It takes three sailors with crowbars to move the rubble and force the door open - down-open, so that when you bring it free, it collapses inwards with an echoing crash. Climb through the gap, into a space that roars with wind -

>>	Name	Back through the Gate of Forms
>>	Description	You've traversed half the length of the stalactite called Godfall, from the monastery to here. The Starved Men cut a tremendous gallery around the whole root of the stalactite, leaving a vast central pillar to support its weight. In its day, the view must have been unrivalled. Remnants of salvaged glass and wooden eating-houses, viewing-booths, sight-temples still cling to the edges - but the root has been shattered, and the stalactite fell.\r\n\r\nGo a little closer - clamber carefully across the tilted surface of the gallery floor towards the shattered stump of the root.
>>>	Description	A dozen corpses, decades-dry lie at the stalagmite's root. You think there was a barricade here, but the fall has smashed it and the remnants have fallen into the sea. Were they defending the root? Gunner Atkins squints at the scorched and shattered rock, and nods wisely. "Gunpowder," he opines. "Blew it up themselves. Killed the whole city. Starved Men, eh? Allus heard they fight each other. Mad as toads."\r\n\r\nIn the immemorial tradition of subterranean adventurers, you search the corpses. Well, it's not like they've been <i>buried</i>. Their bones of their limbs and faces are blurred and twisted, like melted wax... You find trinkets, disgusting remnant-chunks, and oh good God! Yes. Yes, that's worth a bit. Worth a lot. Best not let your men see it.\r\n\r\nNothing else remains here. Signal your ship with flares, and she'll approach: you can scramble down and drop into the zee, to be retrieved. Much safer than the tunnels of Godfall.

It's gives under your touch - slowly, but when you try to pull your hand free, it takes all your strength. Tables and chairs project through the yard-thick amber on the floor - enough to cross, perhaps.
>>>	Description	A zeeman at the back grows complacent. He dawdles too long on an amber-glazed table. His boot sticks when he tries to raise it. With a single scream he topples sideways into the grasping goo! His mates try to tug him free, but the stuff has an iron grip.

A pair of luminous lamp-lighter bees buzz in a latticed ivory tube. There is no other source of light.\r\n\r\nA bandaged shape no larger than a child lies crumpled on a couch.

And perhaps - the emergence - will be less painful -" Its chest pulses feebly. \r\n\r\nYou accept a single huge black pearl. The Curator's fancies grow worse, but it pays well.

As with many languages spoken in dreams, you understand the meaning without understanding the words: a great disaster has been averted, the King's folly is ended by the Princess' cunning, the heralds of night are bound. Yes, the sun is gone, and no, the places below ground are not what had been taught, but perhaps that's for the best, considering. It will be remembered. They will mark their triumph. You wake.

Between gulps and flabbers, it attempts to chat.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to decipher its words. Its mouth is full of fish-flesh; its mind is alien; and besides, it's terribly shy. Consequently, the evening is not a great success.\r\n\r\nBut you learn a little of its past.

It shares jokes from its spawn-world, Axile.

Sea-sound fills the cave, strong and slow, like the long beating of a heart. On a square slab of coral, someone has set up a game of chess. The pieces are different from the ones used in London. You see the spiralling Bishops, the corner Roots, the Kin and the terrible Cream. As you touch each one, a deep voice whispers its name...

It shuffles closer.\r\n\r\n"Shalt-Flions," it wheezes. Unprecedented! A Rubbery capable of human speech (in however debased and pitiful a mode!)\r\n\r\n"My emissary," the cave whispers.

>>>	Description	Move and counter-move. The pieces click and hiss on the board. The victory is easy. The Emissary whimpers and topples his own Kin; he begins to melt like snow in a desert wind.\r\n\r\nScintillack sloughs from the roof, gathers around you in great shining drifts. The voice of the Principles washes over you like the zee, urgently chanting secrets. For every one you hear, another two are lost to the grinding of the rock, or incomprehensible to a mind that has not laired centuries beneath the waves... but you learn, and learn. Your brain is bursting with knowledge.\r\n\r\nNow the voice of the Principles falters, is gone. It subsides into happy mindfulness with a last melodious sigh. The Outcast's face blinks at you from its puddle of goo, and then it too dissolves.\r\n\r\nThe Wakeful Idol which sat on the chess-board now squats by your feet, eyes bright. The Principles had suggested that it would become more, when the Principles became less. It seems a little taller, somehow.

It moves its Night. Your Kin is imperilled.\r\n\r\n"Now I regret," the Principles sighs. "Now at last I regret. I regret trusting you, stranger. And you, my Emissary, who was almost me -"\r\n\r\nThe Emissary makes its final move. You topple your Kin. The cave around you is silent. The Outcast straightens, taller than you have ever seen him: it extends a slippery appendage to shake your hand. Together, you climb the steps back to Port Cecil. The Principles never speaks to you again.

Having the Captain on board gives a bonus to skill checks)\r\n\r\nReturn one last time to Saviour's Rocks for the Festival of Silk and the quest reward.\r\n\r\nAlternate path - burn the tree at the Web of Stone. This changes the Nativity and makes the Scuttering Reaches far more dangerous.

And next to that... wait... LOOK UP?\r\n\r\nFortunately, the sorrow-spider that drops down onto your face is just a little too slow.

Someone has rescued you, but who? Why? And from where comes the sick, lingering fear that you may come to regret this act of anonymous generosity?

>>>	Description	Deep in the darkness by a bridge of webs, a small group of Weavers gather silk from their acrimonious masters' abandoned webs. Their lack of sight hardly seems to affect the silent precision of the work, all done to a rhythm drummed by something only they can hear. Rejected silks are simply left on the ground, their inferiority not visible to regular eyes.

>>>	Description	The cultists politely ignore you as you watch them at work; the Weavers in red, tending the webs, the Widows in green, caring for their masters by reducing grisly foodstuffs to paste and feeding the more senior members of the spider-council by hand.\r\n\r\nIf there is any reason for these assignments, it is impossible to tell. Certainly, there is an assortment of male Widows and female Weavers amongst the cultists' ranks.Perhaps the sorrow-spiders have as much interest in human gender as in spider-gender.

The Emissary of Spiders rises from his meditation at the base, his robe festooned with the most senior members of the council that they might whisper their will in his ear. They speak, of course. Most eloquently, in fact. That does not mean they will lower themselves to speak to you. Not directly.\r\n\r\n"Excellent. Excellent." The Emissary of Spiders bows slightly.

>>>	Description	Branches of webs hang in their thousands from the colossal statue of some being as far from an angel as an angel from a man. The spider-council has made its home in the chipped out eyes, surrounded by its lessers and a precious collection of ensnared unfortunates.

>>>	Description	The sorrow-spiders often resort to cannibalism when food is low. It is on occasion the Weavers and Widows' privilege to share that bounty, that they may be a greater part of the whole. At least the poison has been removed, and the legs are surprisingly effective when pressed into duty as impromptu toothpicks.

>>	Description	A naked young man lies on a stone platform, his shaking hands squeezed tight by his brothers and sisters to be.
>>>	Description	There is no chanting and no singing. There is just a low-pitched noise from the cultists' throats as a sorrow-spider climbs up the initiate's body. He quivers as it reaches his face, drips of excited poison dripping into his lips. Strong, caring, but above all else, firm fingers peel back his eyelids and hold them wide.\r\n\r\nA scream. A mouth silenced with bundled cloth. An embrace. A note raised high and loud, until the Tree of Seasons itself seems to shake in the cacophony.\r\n\r\nA Widow gently kisses his new brother on the forehead, wrapping a silk blindfold around his hollow eyes.

A broken Devil, old enough to have forgotten the smell of brimstone. Their eyes long since harvested to birth the sorrow-spiders' progeny, they hang immobile in darkness, dreaming of oblivion.

"Blind to light is not, however, deaf to rumour. I wonder, might I prevail upon the good natured individual I have heard contributed so much to our little festival? Splendid. Splendid..."\r\n\r\nHe leans in close. "My benefactors have charged me with seeking... a special sustenance for a special occasion. I am sure an experienced zailor such as yourself sees through the necessary euphemism. Shall we say, unfortunates of little future, such as your tomb-colonists? Were perhaps a select few to find a different destination for the greater good, I can promise more than fair compensation for any subsequent regrets."

You don't know how I've dreamed of this stuff since coming here. That Greyfields piss? A vintage for schoolgirls!"\r\n\r\nHe pops the cork and takes a swig, an unpracticed look of happiness spreading across his face. At his gesture, an extra crate is loaded onto your ship.

With a furious insectile screech, sorrow-spiders converge on the stall. The blemmigan is driven into the open! It smashes one spider-carapace with its beak, vaults another spider in a flash of fungal dexterity, fences tendril-to-chelicerae with a third as they both dash up a wall. Then it's gone into the webs, its hyphal slimes protecting him from their sticky adhesions. Spiders pour after it. Who will know its end? Not you. You had nothing to do with this.

Your limbs feel as though they are touched by fire and wind, and you laugh at your blade strikes true. Your luck holds for your next two challengers, and the two after that. You are almost disappointed when the brawl staggers to a halt. One of the courtesans drops the man she was strangling with her silk scarf, and calls for honey-mead for those left standing.\r\n\r\nThe Melliferous Nun - who is entirely unscathed, of course - catches your eye from across the room, and gives you a nod. She takes the caged bee and slips back to Isery's laboratory. A job well done.

>	Name	The Honeyed Tongue
>	Description	The Melliferous Sisters make their home in the richly-appointed stone tower of Cavendish Abbey. Their thick gloves and crimson-mesh helmets are worn, less for modesty, and more for practicality. They tend the hives of the lamplighter bees all across the Isle, and make a religious observance of harvesting red honey for the Pirate-King. [Your actions will attract the Pirate-King's notice. You need 5 x Pirate-King's Notice to gain an offer from a Patron.]

>>	Description	She could, she tells you earnestly, really <i>use</i> a lamentable relic. Best not to ask her what for.
>>>	Description	She is only a recent novice, and barely even inducted into the Lower Apistic Mysteries. Still, she has some useful information to impart: the recent destabilisation of the red honey trade elsewhere has been fortuitous for the Isle of Cats. Honey production can barely meet demand. The Abbess and the Lady of the Gardens are having some kind of dispute over <i>staffing</i>, of all things.

>>>	Description	The Sister tells you that the Pirate-King went to Abbey Rock fifty years ago and asked the Abbess to send some of her novices to Port Cavendish. You ask why, and she shakes her head. "The better question is: why did the Abbess send her precious novices to a place like this?"\r\n\r\nYou suggest a hefty bribe, or perhaps coercion. The Sister cackles harshly. "The Sisters of the Rock respect strength-of-arms, which of course the Pirate-King knew only too well. He challenged the Abbess to a duel, and won. She didn't have much choice then!" She cackles again. "Ask our Abbess if you don't believe me. She was one of those very novices, sent across the zee!"

>>>	Description	You recite your news to the Abbess, your voice stuttering every now and then in the cool silence of her office. Her face is entirely obscured by her thick veil, and it is impossible to read her reactions. Nonetheless, you must have pleased her - she orders one of her novices to load your ship with casks of mushroom wine.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey overlooks the Rose Garden, and so you make a point to linger at the windows. The roses bloom lush and wanton, each petal the colour of sunset. A tall woman in a golden veil picks her way between the thorned bushes.

Someone has gone to great trouble and expense to gild the creature's eyes; they look out over the port, feral and unseeing.\r\n\r\nA caged hive of lamplighter bees hangs from the ceiling like a chandelier. A few zailors give you hard-mouthed, assessing looks but most ignore your presence entirely.

"Everybody wears the cat's eyes here," he tells you, moving aside to let you pass. "Just a friendly reminder that the Pirate-King is watching." It seems that no place, then, is truly lawless.

>>>	Description	"Cat's eyes," one of them says. "For the Pirate-King." As far as you can gather, the Pirate-King's name is Leopold, and he controls all the trade on the island. Half of the Catties believe that he can take the form of a crimson tiger, and creep into their dreams.\r\n\r\nThe other half suspect, more prosaically, that he simply eats those who displease him.

He uncorks it, pours a few drops of thick red liquid down his throat. The vial drops to the floor. When you look back up, he is gone.\r\n\r\nYou blink, and look around. Nobody else seems in the least perturbed that a man - disappeared? - from their midst. You pick up the fallen vial and examine the traces left inside: sticky honey gleaming with redness entirely unlike blood.

You ask what one of those is, and she snorts. "I'm glaring at you underneath this bloomin' veil."\r\n\r\nYou act appropriately cowed, and the Melliferous Sister thaws a little. "We are Bee-Keepers and Honey-Harvesters. The Catties owe their prosperity to us, and the Pirate-King too." She slurps the last of the mushroom-wine behind her veil, and the Barkeep glides over to refill her glass, eyes respectfully downcast.

They are very beautiful, if you like them sharp and glittering and ambiguously gendered.\r\n\r\n"You have caught the interest of the Pirate-King, and therefore <i>my</i> interest as well," they say, fixing you with an amber-eyed gaze. "You seem capable enough. And I have need of a capable... friend."

>>>	Description	Isery's eyebrows lift infinitesimally, but their reply is measured. "When lamplighter bees suck the nectar of this crimson strain of exile's rose, they are driven to madness. They enter the brains of humans and harvest their memories." They make a small gesture, as though to elide the exact process. "Those memories are instilled in red honey. Each sip a burst of memory on the tongue."\r\n\r\n"Each sip," they pause to smile, a little contemptuously, "excruciating for the one whose memories have been extracted. But that is Zaira's domain, rather than my own." Isery watches your face, searching for some particular expression. Perhaps they find it, for they clear their throat, and look away. "Glad you asked?"

"I have a delivery for the Alarming Scholar in London," they tell you, over a meal of fungus-blossom and sea-lily soup. "A delivery that needs to pass beneath the notice of the Revenue."\r\n\r\nIsery places a casket on the table, and slides it open with a dull click. Inside are vials of what is unmistakably red honey. It gleams malevolently.

>>>	Description	"The Scholar will give you some notes in return. Bring them to me, and I shall be most pleased."\r\n\r\nIsery slides the casket over to you, and very pointedly does not enumerate the consequences of returning without the notes. Instead: they smile, too wide, and you shiver.

Isery does not pause in their task of pouring red honey into a cucurbit flask.\r\n\r\n"It is possible to encourage lamplighter bees to seek out one kind of memory over another," they announce, without any preamble. "It's all about what you expose the bee to, once it has drunk the maddening nectar of the crimson roses. But it is an uncertain process. Full of guesswork. The Alarming Scholar and I have been trying to... apply the scientific method, you could say."\r\n\r\nThey look fond for a moment, soft. "I require you to perform a little experiment for me.

"I am very partial to memories of the Far East. Very thoughtful of you."\r\n\r\nHe bestows a humming, honey-soaked kiss on Isery's lips, and then Zaira's, before holding out the vial to you.

Her father threatened to break your legs if you so much as looked at her, but you cannot help yourself. Her hands are softer than anything you have ever imagined, and dappled in warm sunlight. The curve of her smile slices into you like a blade - \r\n\r\nYou come back to yourself in a sudden rush. You are lying on the floor alone, your face wet with stolen tears. On the desk: a Key to the Cage Gardens, which you slip into your pocket, and a gold statuette of a tiger, with eyes of polished ruby. Something about the statuette makes you decidedly uneasy. Still, it will probably sell for a good price.

He then presses a gold statuette of a tiger into your hands. It has eyes of polished ruby; it makes you decidedly uneasy to look into them. Still. It'll fetch a good price.

>>>	Description	It draws you aside into a closet in the Customs House. "Had enough of Visage," it tells you frankly. "Here, you take my mask and pretend to be me, and I'll trade in the visitor mask and get on some departing ship. Get my life back."\r\n\r\nIts face - no, now you see, her face - is aging but unlined. A lifetime of never needing to use a facial expression.

>>>	Description	You say farewell to the Moon-Moth. It makes gestures you now recognise as agitation. Perhaps there was some other plan for you here, but no one consulted you about it. You have other things to attend to.\r\n\r\nYour last sight of Visage: the Moth smoothing the folds from your robe and hanging your mask on a peg for the next visitor.

The arms you fold neatly across themselves in the fashion that is appropriate for this particular robe. \r\n\r\nPerhaps someone after you will care to take up your role.

>	Name	Festival of Flourishing
>	Description	The road you follow leads up through switchbacks along the side of the face, and finally to the ear of Flourishing-of-Years, and into the cave that is her ear. The tunnel bends back on itself and all lights have now been extinguished. There is nothing to guide you but the hand of the person behind you on your back, and the movement of the person in front of you. \r\n\r\nThe one who walks beside you wears a bat mask.\r\n\r\nFortunately the floor of the tunnel is very smooth and presents no stumbling blocks. Sound carries strangely in this place, however. Sometimes you cannot hear your own footsteps, and sometimes a breath comes back to you audible from someplace ahead in line.

>>	Description	You do not really know what this festival is or what it means.
>>>	Description	You try to stop and turn, but there are hands on your shoulders, and steady feet behind you. The passage is narrower and the stone walls are closer than you had thought they were.\r\n\r\nYou cannot go out. There are too many people in too little space. And if anyone were to roll a boulder into the ear of Flourishing-of-Years, then you would be trapped here and there would be no recourse.\r\n\r\n"Steady on," says Bat-mask beside you. His accent is the accent of Wolfstack Docks. \r\n\r\nA moment later there's a pungent ammonia smell, as though he's cracked open smelling salts for you, though in this pure black you can't see a thing for sure.

For how many years has this been done, and for how many will it be done in the future?\r\n\r\n"Watch your step here," says Bat-mask to you in an undervoice. Its accent is the accent of Wolfstack Docks. "Floor is about to get squishier." And sure enough it does.

>	Name	Inside the Hollow of the Ear
>	Description	At last the tunnel opens out. You and all the other congregants spread out in a cavernous space.\r\n\r\nA voice speaks in the darkness, a ritual preparation: "Here at the new year, we gather under the One Mask of Flourishing-of-Years. Her face is turned to the gods.\r\n\r\n"Protected by her mask, we may remove our own. Protected by her script, we may speak outside our parts."\r\n\r\nHere and there is the sound of people fumbling with ties and strings. Your own face feels different with the mask off.
>	Teaser	At last the tunnel opens out...
>>	Description	There are things here to learn, perhaps to your advantage.
>>>	Description	You move stealthily through the dark, hearing one knot of conversation and then another.\r\n\r\nThe secrets exchanged do not offer much leverage. You can't see the owners of the secrets. Here and there you catch the smallest fragment of something that might serve you on a future occasion: the memory of a voyage east, a half-rumour about the Carnelian Coast, a muttering about the Admiralty.

>>>	Description	You manage to stifle yourself. The only thing that comes out sounds like a sneeze.\r\n\r\nHere and there people are talking around you, telling of childhoods in padded nurseries, silenced under the Scarab-shaped baby mask. Other pasts, too, not all lived on Visage.
>>>	Teaser	You manage to stifle yourself...
>>>	Name	Suppressed
>>	Name	Fight the urge to giggle
>>	Description	Those who come as spectators may remain as participants.
>>>	Description	In the deep shadow you hear things that you will never repeat. They are not the most dreadful of secrets or the most evil things you know, but they are entrusted to you as confessions. \r\n\r\nYou needn't guard your face while you listen, because no one can see you. You needn't scheme about how to use the information, because you do not know whose secret this is: it has no use to you, except as a token of connection.

>>>	Description	The light is so sudden, so searing, that someone screams. All around you are... all sorts of things. Some are human, but you see other faces: rubbery, clay, some unrecognizably altered. The Chief Geometer, with his mask off, doesn't seem to be bothering to wear a face at all. Many faces are wet with tears. No one welcomes the blaze of light.\r\n\r\nSomeone throws a cloak over the flare: a mistake, because of course it only begins to burn. After that someone manages to douse both flare and cloak. (Who in this crowd was carrying a bucket of water?) But it is put out, and someone's hands are clamped firm around your wrist.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the last that you see of Visage. You are taken blind back to the docks, your face covered in a black cloth that is no mask at all.

>>>	Description	You hood the flare inside a lantern, but it's still distressfully bright in here.\r\n\r\nYou shine the light on your companion. A man only, with a broad nose that looks like it has been broken repeatedly, and a missing tooth, and scars about the neck as though he has been executed many times. He gives you a sad, sheepish grin. \r\n\r\n"Nothing to see here," he says. "And they'll be putting me to death again soon enough, so you needn't have bothered."\r\n\r\nAlready the others are swarming on him. Before your light goes out, you catch a glimpse of a noose, ready in someone's hand. The bats are not welcome here, it seems.\r\n\r\nThough after your violation of the mask-darkness, you aren't welcome either.

Symbol of the innocent heart that will not be eaten by the jackal. \r\n\r\nThen a bell rings and the time of speech is over. You all begin to put your masks back on. It is possible - you cannot know for sure - that in this cover someone has exchanged a mask with someone else.\r\n\r\nIt is an orderly and perfect line that emerges again from the ear of Flourishing-of-Years. If anyone watches from above, they must surely be satisfied.

>>>	Name	No?
>>	Name	Ask to go about without any mask
>>	Description	Maybe there's more to it than a question of aesthetic taste.
>>>	Description	Moon-Moth explains: each mask declares a different intention towards the denizens of Visage, and must be accompanied by suitable behavior. The Frog is for visitors who, though perhaps clumsy and unfamiliar with local etiquette, have come in order to observe local ways and to make uncouth comments about them. \r\n\r\nThe Locust is for those who seek profit in Visage and would carry away as many goods as possible.\r\n\r\nYou prompt about the Bat. Moon Moth hesitates. "Bat is an ill-omened visitor. Sent as a messenger or a spy. Bat always dies."

>>>	Description	Moon-Moth lifts the mask and places it over your head. The eye holes are large and they are fitted with spectacles. These improve your view of the environment, though you must look bulb-eyed from the outside. There is also a mechanism attached to the mouth piece which magnifies any sounds you make, even your breathing. You start to thank the Moon-Moth and it comes out as a booming croak.\r\n\r\n"May you profit from your visit in knowledge," says Moon-Moth. Its wings fold neatly over its back.

>>>	Description	Moon-Moth settles the locust mask over your head. The eyeholes are covered with a thin gold film through which valuable objects gleam more brightly.\r\n\r\n"May you find a happy harvest," says Moon-Moth. \r\n\r\nThen, when you have partly turned away, it double-knots the ties on its purse, as though you're likely to pick its pockets. Doesn't it know you can see it?

It looks that way, but one cannot rule out the possibility that Moth has real wings.)\r\n\r\n"My condolences," it says, with polite formality, as it sets the bat mask on your face and ties the worn leather straps around the back of your head. The inside of the mask smells of musk.

>>>	Description	From a corner Moon Moth picks up a graduated stick. He shows you how a person standing at the end of the room may dip the stick into the water and use it to measure the water level at a pre-selected point, and how the measurements are compared with measurements written on a calendar. If the water level does not match the calendrical position, an assembly of pipes and drains is used to adjust it.\r\n\r\n"It used to be," says the Moth, "that the water rose and fell of its own accord, and the People Before wrote down what height it reached. Now the water is still, but thanks to their actions, we can replicate the rise and fall so as still to be pleasing to the God of Flood."\r\n\r\nIt completes this explanation with a half-body bow towards the statue of the ram-deity.

>>>	Description	You exclaim at how much you admire this room and its excellent pool. Your words are, as always, amplified into a croak. Other masks turn towards you (crocodile, lotus blossom, crescent moon) but no one speaks. You have garnered a suitable degree of disdain.\r\n\r\nMoon Moth quietly applauds your performance of froghood.

>>>	Description	You make a grab for the jug and come away with a tiny fragment of paint-daubed clay. \r\n\r\nMoon Moth looks scandalized that you would attempt something so locust-like. It hurries you back outside, chittering to itself. Perhaps theft requires a different mask here. At any rate, you're not allowed to keep this one.

>>>	Description	Moon Moth watches inscrutably while you talk about other bodies of water that have impressed you more than this one. Deeper, clearer, colder, more densely populated with fish.\r\n\r\nOther denizens move away from you, and towards one another. Your social function is well performed.

>>>	Description	Moon Moth looks around while you speak. Several of the other masks have heard you. "What are you, a Bat?"\r\n\r\nIt seems this is not the sort of thing that Locusts are supposed to say, supposed to think. Your role is to desire and acquire. Not to notice. Not to exclaim. Not to feel joy or admiration or dread.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours later, you are back at the docks, half-naked. Your locust mask is gone, and with it the strange glimmering tint that it cast on the whole world. You'll remember that.
>>>	Teaser	Moon Moth looks around while you speak...
>>>	Name	Not for you

>>>	Description	You don't get far. The Moon-Moth determines that you're up to some obscure act of counterfeiting or coinage-related espionage.\r\n\r\nIt expects you to explore. Then it expects you to be punished for exploring. That is what happens to Bats.\r\n\r\nYou end up scarred and maskless, back at the dock.

>>>	Description	Moon Moth looks at you without surprise. (Of course without surprise. No such expression can register on a mask. But without the small gestures of agitation that accompany a mistake on your part.) \r\n\r\nIt expects you to ask questions. Then it expects you to be punished for asking. That is what happens to Bats.\r\n\r\nYou end up scarred and maskless, back at the dock.

>>>	Description	You wade into the water and begin gathering coins. People watch you from behind their masks. Moon Moth looks uncertain: you're playing the role of locust flawlessly, but these are sacred.\r\n\r\nYou hesitate for just a moment, your will wavering, and that's enough. The others rush you and drive you out. But you are not made to leave the city, at any rate.

>>>	Description	You wade into the water and begin gathering coins. People watch you from behind their masks, but no one tries to stop you. \r\n\r\nAfter a moment, the other locust masks in the room swarm with you, four and five and six of you together, scraping up the coins from the bottom of the pool, working your way along until everything is gone. \r\n\r\nIt is just how a locust ought to behave.

You are catching something, something about an ancient river and floods that were, when you are interrupted.\r\n\r\nThe Moon Moth does not like you staring at the fragments. Does not like it, and accuses you of being a Bat in disguise, and casts you out.\r\n\r\nYou'll have to come back later, in a new mask.
>>>	Teaser	The sigils are tiny pictures, and the tiny pictures yield a meaning if you stare long enough...
>>>	Name	Heights and depths
>>	Name	Study the calendars drawn on the walls
>>>	Description	The sigils are tiny pictures, and the tiny pictures yield a meaning if you stare long enough. The calendar remembers the heights and depths of an ancient river, one that flowed far away and long ago. It remembers cycles of farming time and flood time and drought time. It remembers a circular stasis, a way of being that repeated in just the same fashion for hundreds of generations.\r\n\r\nThe Moon Moth does not like you staring at the fragments. Does not like it, and accuses you of being a Bat in disguise, and casts you out.\r\n\r\nThat is also part of a cycle.

Not even the gift of a preserved lark, frozen in gelatin with a bubble of song rising from its open beak.\r\n\r\nWhen you depart the Chief Geometer's house, he presses on you a prediction: that one day when you have most need, the earth will swallow you in one place and spit you out in another.

"Best to proceed as if it is the first, don't you think?"\r\n\r\nA veil of gold-mesh obscures only her eyes, leaving her glistening, bitten lips bare. Perhaps a hundred small silver keys jangle in a bunch at her left hip. "I think we should be friends. I'm very important you know - or I was. No, still am." She pauses.

>>>	Description	Moon-Moth explains. People think it means something like 'library of fragments', but this is wrong.\r\n\r\nThe parts in question are like parts in a play.

So it is a considerable coup that you manage to filch one of the scrolls edged in gilt and illustrated in lapis, and tuck it into the giant rubbery belly of your costume.\r\n\r\nIt is probably a coincidence that the Moon-Moth declares your visit to be at an end, shortly afterward.

Apparently it is the etiquette of the place not to prevent a Locust from stealing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps for the same reason, the coins are no more than tiny copper chips each stamped with an eye sigil.

Sipping them will be like swallowing an explosion, all fire and light." \r\n\r\nThe Cannoneer refuses to look away from you until you make some excuse to leave.

>>>	Description	The guards fling the Drownie into the pool. The splash soaks the King, but his dignity is unmarred. The pulsing in the pool intensifies into threshing. The Drownie sinks from view, and the waters grow thick and dark. "Next," the King says peaceably.

>>>	Description	He's speaking of the nature of the wounds - their dramatic effects on the landscapes of the body. He sounds like he's boasting - but a single tear trickles down from beneath his mask. At last the King nods. "The offering is acceptable," he says. Thorn-armoured guards carry the bier through a dark slit behind his throne.\r\n\r\nThe King begins, off-handedly, to outline the cartography of the deep undersea, and the patrol-routes of monsters. He notices your presence and snaps his fingers: the guard ushers you out, but not before you've heard valuable deep-gossip.

>>>	Description	The King makes a chopping motion with his hand. A tide of crabs rushes from the shadows of the Throne-Cyst. They're on the hunter before he can turn, but not before he can scream. The King watches in satisfaction as they swarm the hunter, snipping the flesh from his bones. Thorn-armoured guards block the chamber door.\r\n\r\nWhen it's done; when his cries are long silenced, and scarred bones remain - the King motions you forwards. "Take something," he commands.

>>>	Description	Crocodile is describing the wounds on the body, but the wounds he describes don't match the wounds you see. This is another Visage ritual. He sounds like he's boasting - but a single tear trickles down from beneath his mask. At last the King nods. "The offering is acceptable," he says. Thorn-armoured guards carry the bier through a dark slit behind his throne.\r\n\r\nThe King begins, off-handedly, to outline the cartography of the deep undersea, and the patrol-routes of monsters.

>>	Description	The Drownie court - soggy, chattering, hungry - populate a table of carved coral. The Poissonnier claps his hands. Your crew scurry in with steaming plates.
>>>	Description	There are seven courses, each named. It begins with <i>The First Touch on the Skin</i>: a plate of silky white flesh submerged in yellow sauce - fresh, sharp, shocking. Next comes <i>Struggling Against the Current</i>, a fierce terrine of coursing flavours. It leaves the diners watery-eyed and reaching for their wine. Before they recover, bowls of peligin soup are set before them. <i>"Swallowed!"</i> the Poissonnier intones. The taste is deep and rich and heavy, lining the stomach. Several drownies lift the bowls to their lips to catch the last drops.\r\n\r\nA merciful interlude follows. <i>The Surface, High Above</i> is a mild, palate-cleansing mousse. Afterwards comes <i>Lost Breath</i> - a roulade of still-wriggling tentacles; bitter on the tongue's tip, but departing with a long, mellow aftertaste as it slides down the throat. The penultimate course <i>The Abandonment of the Self</i> is spun with sugar and crunchy with salt. Spherical cages of solidified syrup, containing fiery sweetmeats. The filigree cracks between Drownie teeth. The sweetmeats vanish down damp gullets.\r\n\r\nLast of all, <i>The Promise of What is to Follow</i> - a brûléed cream of inexplicable pungency - indescribably more-ish. The diners lean back, bloated. When their senses return, they call for the Poissonnier and congratulate him upon impeccably reproducing the sensation of drowning in culinary form. "It was not drowning," the Fathomking says, his baritone rolling over their babble. "It was love." He raises his glass to the Poissonnier.

>>	Description	It doesn't look well.
>>>	Description	The question displeases the priests. How ill-omened, even to suggest that the bull might die!\r\n\r\nIf it does die, of course (says one in an aside), there will be another born with the same markings, if not on Visage itself, then somewhere around the Unterzee. Apis is never gone, but sometimes his spirit goes astray. \r\n\r\nTo show you the sort of markings they mean, they lift its tongue, and show you the jewel-coloured scarab on the underside. It looks more like a tattoo than a birthmark.\r\n\r\nThe bull rolls its eyes and pulls its head away.
>>>	Teaser	The question displeases the priests...
>>>	Name	Bad question
>>	Name	Ask whether the bull will be all right 
>>	Description	You could arrange an import through the proper contacts.
>>>	Description	The priests are not impressed with the offer. Moon-Moths are not supposed to partake in commercial or religious endeavours. Besides, it's plain from your offer that you don't understand the requirements for identifying the Apis bull, including the important rule that there can be only one at a time.

>>>	Description	You contemplate the Lion for some time. There is an arithmetic sequence to the count of bows that it performs to each feature: the eyes, the nose, each lip. It is hard to know whether Lion is meant to be her worshipper or her lover. Perhaps the two functions are not very distinct.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the Lion's bows are complete, it passes you with a slight snap of its mask-jaws. It was rude of you to stand there watching. The Moth watches visitors. It does not watch citizens. To do so has violated the strictures of both of your roles.
>>>	Teaser	You contemplate the Lion for some time...
>>>	Name	Service and worship
>>	Name	Silently observe the attitude of the visiting Lion
>>	Description	It offers many forms of inspiration.
>>>	Description	The citizens give many meanings to the face: perpetual beauty; stasis; the idea of looking upward into an unyielding darkness. But most of all they speak of the idea of someone above looking down. The face is not convenient to view from down here. It would look its best from the perspective of the ceiling of the Unterzee, beyond reach.

You don't remember the path being this difficult before.\r\n\r\nThe entry, when you come to it, is plugged with a substance fibrous as spider silk but slick and waxy to the touch. Is this new? Does it grow here? Do they clear it away every year? Is it a form of security?\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't yield to your hand.

Detailed, astute, scholarly questions, about who the original people were who inhabited the island and whether the present citizens are their descendants, and, if not, where the original inhabitants might have gone. It hasn't learned the role of stupid credulity at all.\r\n\r\nCaught off guard like this, you have a hard time answering its questions smoothly. You part with irritation on both sides.

But then she - what's this pictogram? ascended? bloomed? flew away? And consumed with grief he assembled those-who-carve-great-things-from-stone and remade the whole surface of the island.\r\n\r\nThere are several more lines after that, which narrate the cost of the labour contract for the workers, and what was done with all the stone that was carted away, and the compensation given to those who had formerly owned houses on what is now face territory.

A mountain rises behind them all. Light grows at its core.\r\n\r\n"Captain!" your first officer is shouting. "Captain!" You blink. The moth is a muddy swirl on the waves.

>>>	Description	Many boats circle the island, all keeping their distance. The one that gets closest is an extended rowboat painted in yellows, whites and reds. Four servant monkeys strain at the oars, while its true passenger sits in comfort behind a gauze curtain. Just for a moment an eye catches yours, but only for a moment. It would not do for a high-souled ape to see something so beneath its notice.

To their high-souled faces, the accepted name is 'Pentecost apes'. In private though, 'the b___y monkeys' is about as common. It is, one might say, an <i>ad hominoid</i> insult.

If the Penties have come to think that rulers should be buried in ancient temples, then it is ancient temples they will build.

They have been easy to corral, however. Though they do not lack wit, there is not an inventive bone in their hairy bodies, and no amount of stolen humanity has taught them the art of creating engines.

>>>	Description	From here, the lights of home are just a memory. The zee is blacker, its tales more guarded. It is not enough to simply keep zailing; none who try ever return home.

>>	Description	She is inside, snoring. A pair of Pentecost apes stand vigil outside, glaring at you with equal parts malice and their usual avarice for souls.
>>>	Description	The apes snarl and leap, ready to rend with tooth and claw. But something stops them. They fall silent at the sight of the locket hanging from your neck. It is not clear if they desire it, are afraid of it, or are simply confused.\r\n\r\nYou open it, snapping the rust. Inside is a faded picture of a sleeping blonde baby; red ribbon tied around her blanket as tight as she now keeps it around her arm.\r\n\r\nThe larger ape comes close; stares at the photo. The smaller one has to look away. It is said, oft with a scowl, that the Pentecost apes will take anything from the souls they steal. Language. Habits. Gestures. It is rarely considered that, sometimes, they may take the best.\r\n\r\nInside the hut, the Monkey Foundling sleeps soundly, completely unaware of her protectors in the forest.\r\n\r\nIt is time to leave her to her dreams.

>>>	Description	The stench and heat as the gates open are a sucker-punch to your senses. Inside, the stagnant air of the windowless wood palace hangs with sweat and tastes of hair.\r\n\r\nEverything is filthy, and every surface used; the apes as likely to swing across the roof as walk the floors. In prized oases of relative calm, the high-souled conduct themselves with the poise of highborn lords and ladies. Around them, their barely uplifted lessers scamper around exhausted, taking orders and cruelties from all who care to dispense them. In the middle are countless more; a sea of apes longing for advancement and fighting for what they have with tooth, claw and low cunning.

>>>	Description	This is very obviously the oldest part of the temple, around which all else has grown over time. Ancient tapestries hang from walls decorated with portraits of a single ape, clothed in violet and crowned by the sun. He is the First Emperor, the hundred-souled founder of the Empire of Hands. His authority reaches across time.\r\n\r\n"Not much to look at, is it?" declares the Delightful Adventuress. "They say they buried the old bugger with all of them. A hundred of the finest souls. A <i>heca-tomb</i> if you will." She laughs for a moment at a joke only she and perhaps three others in the Neath would appreciate. "Mark of respect by the primates, you know, to say no one else could do half as much with them."\r\n\r\nHer eyes glint. "Let's <i>do</i> something about that."

"I suspect however, we shall not have to worry about a Minotaur lurking in this particular maze. Come on! Such things are hardly a problem for a woman of adventure! This will take but a jiffy."\r\n\r\nShe leads the way with utter confidence, even when it becomes clear she has no idea where she is going. Even when it becomes painfully obvious to all that she is merely turning left at every intersection, confident that eventually this will lead to the exit. The string runs out long before the maze does, yet somehow this does not feel like an insurmountable problem for returning.

In front of that stands a pointedly placed plinth holding three thin pillars and some stone discs.\r\n\r\nThe Delightful Adventuress rolls her eyes. "A Trial of the Mind, it appears. How very adorable. It appears that our monkey friends' ancestors have absorbed more than a few souls with a passion for things of the pulp. Oh, well. That should make things interesting."\r\n\r\nShe slaps your shoulder. "Do the honours, <i>kapitano</i>."

The stonework trembles slightly as if about to collapse, but then settles with just the occasional plink-plink of metal and the tinkle of falling shards and gears of all sizes.\r\n\r\n"Well, that is certainly one solution," declares the Delightful Adventuress, unplugging her ears. "I <i>think</i> though, darling, I shall be taking the rest of those. Cannot fault your thinking! But we would rather reach the centre of this quaint little tomb <i>without</i> ourselves becoming buried in it, would we not? Still, splendid resourcefulness. Splendid. Top marks."

>>>	Description	Muscles, human and primate alike, strain as the Delightful Adventuress harries everyone along. Finally, with a crack and a screech of triumph and exhaustion, the doors slide open. Inside is just blackness.\r\n\r\n"There! Now, chop-chop everybody!" declares the Delightful Adventuress, striding into the dark with a personal glim lantern. Behind her, her monkeys collapse to the ground gasping, occasional stolen words and squeals of protest escaping into the air.

>>>	Description	There is no handle, and though there is a gap that a crowbar could fit through, the door seems too thick to get any leverage. Scratch marks around the side suggest that more than a few monkeys have tried. Around it are gaping holes where gemstones were once seated.\r\n\r\nYou press a hand to the door, holding a candle to the cracks. Stone. Very thick. Even dynamite is unlikely to make much of a dent without bringing the whole temple down around you. There must be a way to open it though. Why would anyone bother building a door that they never expected anyone to be able to get through?

>>	Description	The Exquisite Seneschal said that this frozen drop of red honey might help.
>>>	Description	It is not the usual rush of red honey, but a slow fizzling sense as it spreads through your mouth. For a moment, you have the sense of your body being too big, your blood pumping wrong. Memories hang at the edge of consciousness; unclear, faded. As you look at the inscriptions though, chaos melts into meaning.

>>	Description	The ancient carvings shift between complete nonsense and easy readability as the memories wax and wane.
>>>	Description	A terrible light, cast from afar. A sliver of cosmogone in the darkness; burning cinders ashore the sea of the dead. The apes who are not yet of the Pentecost fear them, but their covetous natures will not be denied. Those who hold them burn harder, yet are cursed with tortured ambition no blood spilling can sate. It is an addictive melancholy. This is the Icterine Age.\r\n\r\nUncounted times hence, he who will be the First Emperor is not yet the First Emperor. It is he who is first blessed to conquer the blue-clad emissaries from the waters of the dead, and drink deep of their stolen lifebreath by cinderlight. So dawns the Cerulean Age.\r\n\r\nThe Pentecost's reach ensorcels the world, shore to shore, and all who are not ape are cast to the dark. The lifebreaths of emissaries from the waters of the dead have birthed the Empire Eternal in blood and light. All forever bask in the glory of the Amaranth Age.

>>>	Description	The memories are diluted, largely unspecific. But that is not important. What this red honey carries is something far deeper; a connection of souls across centuries. The birth of an Empire in which even the lowest could be uplifted, and sparks of greatness itself passed on. Magnified. Never lost with the passing of flesh.\r\n\r\nThis was the dream of the First Emperor; one of unity and evolution, transcendence and glory. His memory was placed here that all could see their true destiny. Purpose. Instead, it is as if the Emperor himself is receiving a glimpse of the Empire his dream became.\r\n\r\nHis tears run uncontrollably down your cheeks.

"Well, that is what happens when one decides to build oneself a fancy-dancy snake pit and neglects to think of a way for the poor darlings to be kept fed, isn't it? Come on then, get up from there!

The thousands of snakes. The thousands of venomous snakes. The thousands of... dead, dried-up snakes.

Its rage is focused entirely on her, the Ghost of the Ash Isthmus, and the bright soul with which it can uplift itself to glory.\r\n\r\nIt limps from some trap earlier, its fur blood-soaked and glistening. It lunges at the Monkey Foundling, who half rolls, half falls off the stump and yelps as it catches her by the leg. She rolls; shrieks her own howl as she lashes back with a kick that shatters fang and splits its lip. This only further enrages the frothing ape. It strikes!

It collapses to the ground, hard.\r\n\r\nIt is not a child's face that looks up at you. Still, you reach a hand down. The Monkey Foundling just stares at it for a moment, something human returning as the adrenaline fades. For a moment it almost looks as though she will take it. But no. She leaps up on her own, bounding away towards the dark safety of her jungle.\r\n\r\nAnd then stops. Hesitates. She looks back, and tilts her head, beckoning you to follow. It is a look that suggests the game is over, but perhaps not yet quite finished.

Her right hand searches blind for something, anything, to use as a weapon. It closes on a rock. With everything her tiny frame has, she drives it into the side of the monkey's head, and again and again until all that remains is shattered skull and mush.\r\n\r\nShe stands. Drops it. Shoots you a look of... disappointment? The bitterest. And she bounds effortlessly up the nearest tree and away.

She watches you struggle for a while, but then walks off, out of sight. Only for a moment though, before she returns, casually dangling... a wasps nest? It looks like it.\r\n\r\n"This <i>my</i> island," she hisses. "You not welcome!"\r\n\r\nThe world explodes into stinging, buzzing agony as she pushes it down over your head.

The Monkey Foundling of course is unconcerned, as much at home here as high in the branches or running the forest paths.

Inch by inch, step by step, you slowly make your way across.\r\n\r\nUntil, bored, the Monkey Foundling suddenly jumps up and down, hard. The tree rolls under your feet; your balance fails. You slip, tumble; are embraced by a marsh whose smell will never leave you. You fight to the surface, streaming brown and dripping green, violently coughing up a gagging throatful of the foul slime.\r\n\r\nThe Monkey Foundling sits cross-legged in the safety of the trees, holding her nose as she points and laughs.

Pity however, turns out to be casually and without warning cutting through the rope dangling you in the air and sending you falling back with a surprised thump to the muddy forest floor. It knocks the air out of your lungs, but you are otherwise unharmed. She pauses for a moment to make sure, before her grin spreads back again and she races off to continue the game.

One of them even produces a can of fuel, lighting both the bat and a good part of the roof ablaze.\r\n\r\nThe show ends as the fires are extinguished.

Once uplifted however, their attentions soon turn to finding the <i>right</i> souls, both individually and as a mix. There is no greater honour for an Emperor than to be entombed with their souls unreclaimed. It is a declaration that none other could hope to do as much with them.\r\n\r\nOf course, what they see as uplifting could be simple copying, nothing more.

"TO THE EVER SHINING LIGHTS OF HOME!"\r\n\r\nA cheer rises as the pirates raise their mugs; drain them dry. But there is something quiet in the silence. They have long decided that what they have done here disqualifies them from ever again walking on Wolfstack Docks, from singing in the Mandrake... and from meeting the eyes of those they loved. It is not fear that keeps them from asking the visiting captain for safe passage back home. It is agreement, unanimous.\r\n\r\nThe Boisterous Pirate slams his hands together in an echoing slap.

>>	Description	"Four yards west," you murmur, "and six south. Beneath the jaws of the phosphor-eel." You open your eyes. You are standing at the edge of the dock, in the place the Fathomking told you. You dare not hesitate: you dive straight into the zee, and the waters close over your head.
>>>	Description	Your oiled garments offer a little protection, but the cold is stunning. Your breath bursts from you in a spray of bubbles. You have only moments - and it's so dark! How can you find a stone fragment, here under the black water?\r\n\r\nThe Fathomking is leagues away, but he is the lord of all things lost at zee. His directions were preternaturally precise. The eyes and jaws of the eel glimmer brightly through the blackness where it lairs at the foot of another dock-pier. It draws its head back, as if in homage. In its greenish glow, you glimpse a flake of stone carved with letters. You seize it and strike out desperately for the surface.\r\n\r\nYour crew have fires burning on the dock. They strip off your zee-soaked clothing and wrap you, shivering desperately, in warm furs. Your fist is closed tight around the flake of stone: a thread of blood leaks. At last you prise your fingers open. You read the remainder of your father's name, and the words: SERVED THE CHAPEL OF LIGHTS. [The Chapel of Lights is not far to the south. Go there to end this.]

Your bones tighten, your eyes sharpen, your blood pounds! Your zailors back away as you raise it, growling with feral energy.\r\n\r\nIt fades. You are yourself again, though something remains - something that would devour kings. And this - this pitiable knot of brown bones, picked clean by zee-air and isle-rat - this is your father.

It is not an easy descent from the roof, but it is one you have no shortage of incentive to make.\r\n\r\nBack in the Vault, Barnabas continues clearing the blockage, lacking the agility to escape your way.

He could be mistaken for a statue, if not for an almost imperceptible nod to grant his seneschal permission to speak in his name.\r\n\r\nShe approaches, arms folded in the red-trimmed yellow robes of a court mandarin. Her expression is carefully blank; the chestnut hair on her face powdered alabaster white and decorated with exquisite detail in red and black.

"We starve, and you would prevent us being fed. We thirst to explore, and you cage us like animals. Why? For what fine purpose? What threat are we to you, who happily dine with devils?"\r\n\r\nShe shakes her head, almost with pity. "What could you possibly see in us that shames you so?"

"We also seek souls to uplift our brethren that they may join the work. You will of course be reasonably compensated for your expenses, and rewarded upon completion."\r\n\r\nShe also hints that there may be faster ways to complete the Zeppelin.

A thing to think about, should it be their wrath that concerns."\r\n\r\nShe bows, curtly. "I bid you welcome to the Empire of Hands," she says in her normal tone, as two servants close the door to the Silent Gallery in your face.

"But we would not be here without one human, one with the bravery to stand against the prejudices of their bat-people.

Us poor little primitives, daring to dream ourselves your equals."\r\n\r\nThe Exquisite Seneschal backs away. Her Emperor's tone is caramel laced with glass, fifteen souls united in hate.\r\n\r\n"You wish my favour?" He gestures for a box. "I wish for fire. I wish for flame. I wish for those who have starved us to lie in the streets, their corpses spurned by the rats and the mangiest of your hounds. All this was to come to pass before the voyage. All was planned. But, time."\r\n\r\nThe box is pressed into your hands. "I grant you a chance then, to use as you will. Deliver this. Throw it to the zee. It matters little.

A long time ago, some rather careless people made these images to imprison Fingerkings. I'm not so careless. I can use it to enact my revenge on the 'king that took my hand." He is gloating. He actually strokes his moustache with his hook.\r\n\r\nHe retires to his cabin to investigate the serpent-image, but emerges a day later disappointed. "Different geometries," he explains obscurely.

An increasing preoccupation with these items. \r\n\r\nFinally, a decision: to meet the compulsion, to go to Nuncio and be rid at last of the remnants.\r\n\r\nThe postmen do not bring the dead letters to Nuncio.

"Stop, stop stop! You're swamping the reassembly room!"\r\n\r\n \r\nAn hour later you're standing in front of a glass dome in one of the Dead Letter Office's back rooms. In the pure air under the dome, the letters are reassembling themselves, burning in reverse until they are whole again.\r\n\r\n \r\n"You think we didn't try that?" says the postman on shift, staring gloomily at the pile.

Neat stitching, gilded buttons, a thin but dignified circle of braid at the collar.\r\n\r\nInside, a patch that goes over the heart, stitched with six red letters.

>>>	Description	You get further this time. Three twists; six; ten. The cavern is at least a hundred feet wide at this point, and there is no sign of the bottom. The things on the shelves are labelled in languages you can't read. There are rusty iron boxes, wooden planks, clay tablets.\r\n\r\nNow here is a thing you might hope to understand: a packet wrapped in oilskin. Rolls of maps, depicting unfamiliar shorelines. Annotations concerning the creatures of the deep. A mark where the captain drowned his astrolabe (as a sacrifice, or out of fear?). \r\n\r\nCenturies old the message may be, but seafarers have the same needs and the same fears.\r\n\r\nYou pick apart the knot on the captain's diary and spread the pages. A prickling heat sweeps over your scalp. You can't read the words. You can't read the words. You can't read the words. \r\n\r\nWhen you get back upstairs, empty-handed, you remember the story you could not read. There was a field of stars and it was swarming with maggots.

You exhaust one candle after another.\r\n\r\nAt the end you come to a place where the ramp opens onto a bowl-shaped floor. The cavern must be hundreds of feet wide, here. You light your flare, but even that does not show the cavern walls.\r\n\r\nThe floor is carpeted with - at first you think it is gravel, but no, it is broken shards of clay and stone, all scribbled over in words too old to read.\r\n\r\nAt the centre of this space is a needle of deep black rock, glossy as resin, glittering with ice, inscribed with three arcane sigils that hurt to look at. You feel a meaning in their presence: a prohibition, or a commandment. That all things must come to their destined place. That what cannot be delivered immediately must be saved against a future date. That a message that goes unheard is a tragedy.\r\n\r\nThat the signal must be carried, no matter how far, no matter through what darkness, no matter whether the sender still lives nor whether the recipient can even read the language of the writing-\r\n\r\nThe inscription resolves itself and is known to you.\r\nNO WORD LOST.

"Not going to understand it no matter how much you explain," he says. "And I'm glad, as if I did understand I'd be likely to run mad, working where and as I do."\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he adds, "Likely you'll forget. At least, forget some of it. After all you never wore the uniform." Then he points out where your hair has singed at the temples, and gives you an ointment he keeps in a drawer.

The air blazes. The floor is carpeted with shards of clay and stone, a mosaic of tans and reds and glittering obsidian. The ceiling is so far away that you can barely make it out.\r\n\r\nAt the centre of this space is a needle of deep black rock, glossy as resin, glittering with ice, inscribed with three arcane sigils that hurt to look at. It takes the sunlight's glow and blossoms with it: this is something that once knew that light. You feel a meaning in their presence: a prohibition, or a commandment. That all things must come to their destined place. That what cannot be delivered immediately must be saved against a future date. That a message that goes unheard is a tragedy.\r\n\r\nThat the signal must be carried, that the light can traverse any darkness, that all languages can eventually be translated-\r\n\r\nThe inscription resolves itself and is known to you.\r\nNO WORD LOST. \r\n\r\nThe sunlight is spent.

It clinks as you hand it over.\r\n\r\n"By way of thanks," he says, producing a small leather-bound volume from within his double-breasted coat. "Should your shifts here be at all tedious. No, no, I don't need it! I've read it three times on the voyage here."\r\n\r\nYou read three and a half pages before the creeping terror of it forces you to light a second lamp.

There's nothing to do other than to read a postal instruction manual.\r\n\r\nYou learn that, on recent stamps, a slight blemish on the Empress's crown marks where the legitimate stamp press was damaged by a Revolutionary bomb. The absence of this blemish indicates forgery and requires that the letter be returned to its sender. \r\n\r\nDelivery of a letter that should not be delivered is a postal misdemeanour punishable by the docking of wages, assuming, of course, that anyone ever finds out about it, which seems exceptionally unlikely.

As it chugs out of port, an azure Khanate trimaran slides into its place. \r\n\r\nIn the morning a Taiman flag hangs over the governor's mansion. The White-and-Golds walk the streets of the colony, glancing narrowly left and right. The tea is served without milk, now. The street signs are written in Khaganian characters first, and Roman ones second. The work of the sapphire mines is not interrupted even for a moment, but the tightly nailed boxes that emerge sail north, now, not west.

>>	Description	Restore the Carnelian Coast to the tigers.
>>>	Description	The Carnelian colonists always lived in fear of tigers on the streets after dark. Of a crimson, gorging uprising. In fact, the rebellion is practically bloodless. It turns out that if you put someone in a room with a tiger, they will agree to anything.\r\n\r\nYour agents ensure no doors are locked, and that the garrison has rifles and bullets, but no firing pins. Hapless guards flee as the Banded Prince pads into Heartscross House. You watch the Governor sign the colony over to its original inhabitants. The Prince and his confidants are discussing condiments. The Governor's pen trembles.\r\n\r\nThe humans who weren't members of Her Majesty's Foreign Office are permitted to stay. The tigers have grown accustomed to the advantages provided by thumbs and fingers.

If the creature could stand it would be - what? - eight feet tall? Ten? Exceptional; not monstrous. Its skin is grimy; its hair lank. Above its nose is a swirl of scarred tissue: a single eye, seared closed. "Was this the very gigante blinded by Odysseus?" the Showman wonders. "We cannot say, of course."

This lady defied his prohibition. Behold the result."\r\n\r\nA figure sits on a chair in the middle of the tent. It mumbles a polite, but indistinct, greeting as the audience crowds around the edges. Its dress is faded at collar and cuff, but clean and fitted. The body within is uneven. One shoulder is high, the other low. Its spine bends like a crook. Its face is a knot of bubbled flesh, dark eyes gleaming in the mass. "If you have the gumption, you may touch the lady's face. She is of a scholarly inclination, and will not bite. She has learned her lesson."

Necks crane.\r\n\r\n"I confess," the Showman is compelled to explain, "this gentleman is not a native of the Elder Continent. However, as an aficionado of the remarkable, I could not deny him a place in this exhibition. Steel yourselves." \r\n\r\nThe lights come up. My. How peculiar.

If you want something worth sobbing about, you need only <i>ask.</i>" She glances over her shoulder, smiling warmly. "Ah, Captain!

Enough of this incompetent fingerplay! Get out of my sight before I write down your name."\r\n\r\nShe sits up, scowling. "He wants the Pirate-Poet. Of course he does. Not Unfinished, but not obeying her clay? Such an anomaly, the poor little pebble. Hmm. This may be difficult. She was a dear friend once. She knows better than to let me use that against her."

"We could get rid of that silly hood, perhaps... yes, something in taffeta would be wonderful for turning those crags into curves, don't you think?"\r\n\r\nThe Pirate-Poet growls.

Once one has sampled the cloths from behind mirrors, it is quite obscene to return to the mundanity of cotton and silk. Velvet, of course, is another matter entirely. Such a fabric!"\r\n\r\nThe Modiste cuts a slice of fruit tart, licks the side of her knife. "Oh, to show you my finest creations. I would dress you in razors and arsenic and the dream-dyes of Parabola. Tsk, forbidden! When my friends and I first set zail as the Set, we knew no such creative cowardice.

It has been too long since our last little salon, and the... unpleasantness."\r\n\r\nThe Modiste adjusts the bodice she is sewing, pins it in place. "Ah, but the wonders we once crafted in the waxlight. The Perfidious Composer, every betrayal a new operetta. The Ender of Critics, knives blunt as their wits. The Silent Sculptress, so unjustly exiled when the truth emerged about her torments of clay and bone. Such fine teas she served. Then, yes, there was the Pianolist and our dear, dear Poet too, but-"\r\n\r\nHer finger slips, a drop of blood flowering on white lace. "Blast it," she mutters. "Not even this year's red."

Something catches you as you fall to the deck; a softness behind the pain. Your head rests in folds of silk. A cool, tender caress.\r\n\r\n"Ssssh," whispers the Modiste, cradling your head in her lap; tipping it back. Her knife slices playfully across your throat, just enough to leave its mark.

Fortunately, her salvaged possessions also include the jangling money-purse on her belt, fat and ready to pay the traditional freedom-price of her current bounty. As much as the crew <i>could</i> subdue her, all are relieved once she is aboard a lifeboat, rowing away through the darkness towards Gaider's Mourn.

In London I learned to write my own, and in that moment, I was free. One day... others of my homeland will read them, and they too will learn. One day, my King's dreams must end."\r\n\r\nDinner follows; hot wine and cold spiced meats. Sailors openly place bets on whether she actually eats. The Pirate-Poet ignores them. Her stoic facade doesn't even quiver until dessert is served. At that, just for a moment, even she cannot hide a slight smile.\r\n\r\n"<i>Sorbet</i>, Captain?" she asks, eye-ridge raised.

>>>	Description	The Pirate-Poet glares at the Modiste. Her clay muscles are tense, bulging. But just as quickly, the fight drains away. She slumps, wasting no energy on inevitable defeat. For now at least, there is no escape. The Modiste directs the crew to clamp the ship's heaviest irons around her wrists. The Pirate-Poet causes no trouble as she is led to the brig. Her sword is confiscated and placed in storage.

"I will alight at the next port. I will not spend a moment more than I must in this floating temple of barbarism." She whirls, finger jabbing from across the deck. "Carry a knife, Captain. Carry a knife in the dark, for you will find no safety in a candle."

"I expected no better from you."\r\n\r\nShe draws her sword. A crewman quickly meets its blade. It takes several more minor injuries before the others finally subdue her, but she is outnumbered and has nowhere to go. She accepts her defeat, submitting to the heavy iron shackles. The sword is put in storage.

"Splendid. There is a small fragment of mirror embedded in the poor dear's left eye; a long story, which like most of the best stories involves explosives. When we are ready, I will send a challenge through Parabola. She will not be able to resist. The pain alone should provide sufficient incentive." [Use the ushabti at zee to summon the Pirate-Poet.

>>	Description	It is almost time to hand her over.
>>>	Description	The defiant eyes of the crew stare at you as you enter the brig. They shuffle nervously, but still stand firm between you and the Pirate-Poet's cell. How many times have they ventured down here to hear her words of freedom and rebellion?\r\n\r\nOne has been volunteered as spokesman, his voice trembling as he fails to meet your eyes. Still, he forces out the words. "Can't let you do this, Cap'n. We've heard her poems and what she says, what they can do... they're too important. If it was for <i>you</i>, we'd... we'd right understand. But not for her. Not for Frocks."

>>>	Description	It is the last thing the Pirate-Poet was expecting. "I had prepared myself for death. I had almost prepared for chains and to be lost to clay once again. This..."\r\n\r\nShe bows her head, gesturing to a crewman to retrieve her belongings from storage. "Please. Take my sword. It will serve you well. Practice with it. Master it. Let our next battle be one of legend instead of poetry."\r\n\r\nThe crew escorts her to a lifeboat before you can change your mind. Behind you, the Modiste's angry glower is almost as strong as her perfume. "Captain! You would betray my trust on the eve of my most glorious creation? You... <i>disappoint</i> me. I will endure this floating temple of barbarism not one second longer!"\r\n\r\nShe disembarks in Polythreme, dragging her steamer trunks behind her. The crew, at least, breathes easier.

>>>	Description	"I submit. I ask just one kindness. Use my sword. It will strike true." The Pirate-Poet kneels, looking around at the crew that had dared speak up for her. "I... thank you. This is a fitting end. It is more than I once hoped for."\r\n\r\nShe looks back at you. She nods. She closes her eyes as you drive the sword through her chest; the crack of hard clay, an unexpected softness that embraces the blade as it reaches her heart. There is no breath to stop, no blood to drip from the wound. The silence of her death is barely quieter than her final moments.\r\n\r\nWhat remains cannot even be called pottery, for that implies at least a degree of care and craft. The shape which was once the Pirate-Poet suddenly seems little better formed than a bored child's first dabblings, mistakable for a person only in the dimmest light. Poetry crumbles. Already, little is readable.\r\n\r\nYou pull back the sword; its stickiness drying in the sombre air. The Modiste will not be happy about this. If she dares complain though, she is welcome to sweep up.

>>>	Description	Two Clay Men are waiting at the docks. They take custody of the Pirate-Poet with the expected stoic politeness, binding her limbs and dragging her by the arms to whatever passes for her King's mercy.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, the Modiste returns in possession of a small idol. Those unfortunate enough to pass by her cabin begin complaining of a buzzing in their teeth, a ringing in the ears that never quite goes away.\r\n\r\n For several days she works in secret. The crew savours the peace and quiet. Soon enough though, there is a frantic knock on your cabin door. The Modiste waits impatiently, shaking with sleepless energy, and armed for battle with scissors and measuring tapes.\r\n\r\n"Captain! Divest yourself of those peasant rags at once." She beams. "I have come to make you <i>glorious!</i>"

These are tailored, precisely cut to your every line and curve, and radiate a life that makes all other fabrics seem withered husks. These garments do not hang, they caress; carry the warmth of a lover's arms in a soft bed. And they are strong. Small cuts even heal on their own, leaving only easily plucked fabric scabs.\r\n\r\nThe Modiste glows with pride, with satisfaction. These are just the start, she assures you. Her next should feel much less like wearing a scream.

>>	Description	She knows you to be honourable. She accepts. If you defeat her, she will accept her fate quietly.
>>>	Description	The crew steps back, forming a ring around the brig. The Pirate-Poet is released from her cell, given a moment to stretch. She nods her readiness. The battle begins.\r\n\r\nShe fights as she writes; heavy, heartfelt blows that pound deep and true. You fight your best, pit your skill against her strength. It is a fool's errand. Soon enough her heavy arms are wrapped around your throat, choking the life from you. You have no choice but to signal surrender and fall, gasping, at her feet.\r\n\r\nThe Pirate-Poet extends her hand to help you up. "Bring me my sword," she demands. A crewman quickly fetches it from the stores. "You did not have to offer me this chance. I will always be grateful. Please. Accept this. Master it. Make our next battle an epic beyond poetry."\r\n\r\nYou take the sword. The Modiste will not be happy about this when she finds out. Fortunately for you, she will have no shortage of mutinous crew to take it out on once the Pirate-Poet is far away in a lifeboat.

The battle begins.\r\n\r\nShe fights as she writes; heavy, heartfelt blows that pound deep and true. You cannot hope to beat her in a straight battle, and so don't even try. She is not used to such a skilful opponent; one able to roll with the punches, to use her weight and momentum against her - to save the effort until she makes one fatal mistake.\r\n\r\nThe watching crew gasps as she tumbles, falls, ends up flat on her back. They do not dare refuse when you call for your largest gun. With a blunderbuss staring directly into her face, even the Pirate-Poet must yield.

As its ripples fade, a musical voice echoes in the dark with the crackle of an ill-maintained phonograph.\r\n\r\n"Greetings to you! Greetings and well-wishes, fellow Captain! You have betrayers on board, of a Set untimely scattered. We would witness our betrayers taste betrayal. Such exquisite irony! So much to be learned! Will you yield them to us?"\r\n\r\nThe breezy musical voice shifts to the minor key.\r\n"Your immediate response is politely demanded."
>	Teaser	The <i>Irrepressible</i>! - 
>>	Description	She seems mystified by the voice's demands, but one thing is clear: she will not go willingly.
>>>	Description	She fights every step of the way, a look of absolute terror on her face. Her eyes meet yours at the threshold of the airlock atop the vessel, before the gun in her face forces her to slowly descend the ladder into its depths.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, a grinding sound of pain and cracking bone rises from the zubmarine's belly, suddenly cut off and replaced with... Vivaldi? The high-notes pierce your ears, the low ones dig deep into your gut.\r\n\r\n"Extraction is complete. Nothing of interest remains."\r\n\r\nA smaller airlock opens. Inside, a box. Inside that, a heart. Cold, desiccated, punched through with hundreds of holes that bring to mind a roll of pianola paper.\r\n\r\nThe <i>Irrepressible</i> submerges. Its ripples soon disappear. So, you are alerted, does the Pirate-Poet. Her cell is open, and a lifeboat missing. Connected? It hardly matters. Without the Modiste, you have nothing to gain from her anyway.

And down she goes.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, a grinding sound of dancing sawblades rises from the zubmarine's belly, suddenly cut off and replaced with... Vivaldi? The high-notes pierce your ears, the low ones dig deep into your bones.\r\n\r\n"Extraction is complete. Nothing of interest remains."\r\n\r\nA smaller airlock opens. Inside, a box. Inside the box... a heart. Moistened, still warm to the touch. Drilled through with holes, like a roll of pianola paper.\r\n\r\nThe <i>Irrepressible</i> submerges. Its ripples soon disappear.

Behind them, the hatch slams shut.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, a grinding sound of pain and cracking bone rises from the zubmarine's belly, suddenly cut off and replaced with... Vivaldi?

Blood drips down your sleeve from superficial wounds, easily ignored for now. She doesn't blink as she dabs away a scratch of her own from one exquisite cheek. Again, a clash of weapons!

They are not at all like that beastly Aestival affair. You would have enjoyed Codex. The carvings, and the refreshingly quiet locals."\r\n\r\nShe chews her lip for a while, watching the Pirate-Poet compose. "Such a pity you never let the Sculptress have her little fun. The things she could do for you with her hammers and chisels. Horns! Fangs! Wings of shimmering bone! Mothers would scare their children to sleep with tales of your face alone." She smirks. "Need I even <i>describe</i> the perfect costume I would design?"\r\n\r\nThe Pirate-Poet gives it some grudging thought.\r\n\r\n"No bl___y arsenic," she grunts. "And no bl___y taffeta."

"Sweetie, what is the purpose of our little Set if not to struggle for Art's own liberation? It is not just our own muses we give flight, but all creations that our humble work makes more palatable to the boorish <i>ignorati</i>."\r\n\r\n"I do not think the rest... see it that way."\r\n\r\n"In their hearts, they do.

"More to the point, I will have you know that my dabblings in Nevercold Brass were most sought after!"\r\n\r\n"I..." The Pirate-Poet hesitates. "I miss the chains, sometimes. Things were... simpler before the poetry. Before I could-" She crosses out a stanza. "Before my head was always full of words <i>I can never get right!</i>"\r\n\r\n"We call it being an <i>artist</i>, my dear. Is it any wonder so many of us go crackers?" The Modiste pats her hand fondly. "The words will come, sweetie. They always do. Art cannot be rushed."\r\n\r\nA pause. "Perhaps it <i>should</i> be chivvied along though, under the circumstances.

>>	Description	Place your head in the hollow. Await the blade, and your death, that you may become a candle for the multitude.
>>>	Description	After the sacrifice, when the captain's neck has been cleanly severed and their blood pooled on the steps, the pithing process begins. The outer integument is peeled away and their bones, organs, muscles removed. This remnant will be given false life with the glyphs, so that it may wait with a bright sword in the chapel until one day, another sacrifice may come. The old executioner will be retired and given to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe captain's skin will be filled with glory. The attendants will place it in the mould and pour the wax donated by lesser celebrants. The wick will be emplaced, down through the crown of the head to the hollow of the groin. The Priest will recite the lessons once more, and replace the captain's eyes in the skin of the sockets for the living wax to grasp them. The odour of searing will fade. The woman from the Second City will coax the flesh with oils until it resembles life. The glyphs will be imparted and the chest will heave with false breath.\r\n\r\nAt last you will rise and take your name. You will leave the chapel in the shape of the captain, and take your place aboard the captain's ship. No one will ever know. The differences will be invisible. Perhaps one day a sweetheart will trace the scar around your neck and ask laughingly, were you once beheaded? And you will shrug and answer, "Only once."

A chorus of rats begins chanting 'thank you'. You do not keep count, but it seems they intend to go the full distance.\r\n\r\nThe First Minister's gratitude is less symbolic.

The Chief Engineer nodded towards the distant hill.\r\n\r\n"One day we braved the depths of the Chickenwoods, and from the top of Mount Ararat we plucked the Rat Star to be our light; our beacon.

We passed through a number of what can only be termed check-points, as fierce-eyed rats shouldered their derringers and saluted the Chief Engineer. Soon we come upon a small colony, smaller than some of the infestations I had encountered in London flats: perhaps only fifty Rattus Faber all together, working diligently to fortify their side of the island.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>The first thing I noticed was a brilliant light, beaming out from a stump of Chickenwood about six feet high; it bathed the whole settlement in a clean blue glow, and was almost too bright to look at. By its light I could see several raised mounds of earth, suggesting shallow tunnels.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>An efficient fishing operation was set up by the water: an albino rat mending nets while others stabbed sharpened sticks into the waves. Further inland was a barracks, where a sergeant barked drills at a small squadron of fighters.</i> \r\n\r\n<i>My arrival drew attention, and several rats paused in their work to look at me curiously.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>"Welcome to Murinia," said the Chief Engineer, voice warm with pride. "It's not much to look at now, but it will be once we've rousted the Cavies. Take a stroll around while I summon the war council."</i>\r\n\r\n<i>With that he vanished into one of the mounds and left me to explore.</i>

The Cavies are bigger and there's more of 'em. We're better with weapons, but haven't got the stuff to make 'em with; most of us came here as stowaways and brought nothing but food, tools, and the fur on our backs. We can fish, and we nibble the Chickenwoods, but we can't make guns out of trees. The Cavies came with their own steamer, and seem to have endless supplies - we raid 'em, sometimes, but there's so few of us, and we can never hold on to territory gained for long. But that's of no consequence - all we want is to be left in peace to build our Republic. And the Rat Star," she added thoughtfully, after a moment. "Of course. We want that too."</i>

But unlike any I'd seen before: blue as a sapphire, but more brilliant. Something about the clarity of its colour was tremendously soothing.

We took this from the island's centre, Mount Ararat - only it's not a mountain, of course, any more than this is a star! It's hollow - there's sweet water inside, and coral crawling all up the walls of it. But nothing that glows, save this. It's ours now and no one can take it from us!"</i>

How unlikely. I suppose you will have no trouble slitting this savage's throat on our behalf?"\r\n\r\nMy fraction of a moment's hesitation was all the confirmation the Seneschal needed. "See to the ship," she snapped, and half the party scurried to intercept the rats skulking aboard it, screaming war cries that curdled my blood.\r\n\r\n"As for you," said the Seneschal, sweetly, "thank you very kindly for your gift. I assure you it is most graciously received."\r\n\r\nMore swiftly than I would have thought possible, the Seneschal leapt onto the rat I held bound and sank her incisors into its chest.

We passed through a number of raised mounds of earth mixed with fortifying strips of mushroom flesh, which I supposed to be makeshift walls.\r\n\r\nThe settlement was dazzling: this side of the island appeared to be absolutely wreathed in scintillack. The Cavies' dwelling was awash with silver phosphorescence.\r\n\r\nIt was a large colony; most noticeable was the steam-pinnace - the 'Impossible Lamb'? - that had run aground, from which Cavies came and went, bearing supplies. To the right of the ship, farther down the beach, a large group of Cavies lay on bundles of colourful cloth, whining and wailing as if in pain; to the left of the ship was a ramshackle tent of poles and linen in front of which guinea pigs clashed against each other and sharpened their teeth.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the village was a covered dais, veritably festooned with colourful cloth and guarded by well-decorated knights. I suspected this was where King Gracegnaw kept council.\r\n\r\n"Be welcome, Captain, in the Kingdom of Cavia, Capitol of our Isle and Blessed by the light of Our Lady's Eye." The Seneschal spoke solemnly, but with a hint of sadness to her words. "Or so it was, and shall be again. I must speak with our King and prepare your arrival. My Page will show you the area, and bring you in sight of His Splendour in good time. Page!"\r\n\r\nA much smaller guinea pig, its fur braided with a slender strip of Parabola linen, scurried over, and bowed. The Seneschal took her leave.</i>

They bathed in Her, they drank Her sweet waters, and the strong brought the weak to Her in turn. Soon we were thriving again, bearing our children and raising them to love Our Lady's Eye and see in it our deliverance."\r\n\r\nThe elder looked sorrowfully at the sick under his care.\r\n\r\n"Since the rats stole Her, the sickness has returned. All this light is but a mockery of Hers, and we gain from it no benefit.

Is it not splendid?"\r\n\r\nIt certainly may have been, at one time, but I could see the hull had been severely damaged by the scintillack reef; there was no way the Cavies could hope to repair it themselves.

I was rewarded with a substantial amount of scintillack.\r\n\r\nI saw, to my surprise, that the Cavies had spared a number of the Rats' children, and were rounding them up. I commented favourably on this, praising the Seneschal's high-minded mercy.\r\n\r\nThe Seneschal chittered pleasantly. "My dear Captain. Be assured that we shall treat them very well. But it is hardly mercy that motivates the preservation of an enemy's livestock."\r\n\r\nA small rat wept quietly over a parent's severed torso before being prodded and pressed into a march.</i>

There: a cove thick with Chickenwood, too small and cramped to fear the mooring of a boat. \r\n\r\nMy crew rowed me towards the very knife's edge of shadow cast by the blazing Eye, and I carefully swam the rest. From shore it was an easy enough matter to pick my way towards the settlement - and once I was within twenty feet of the Eye, I sprinted.\r\n\r\nI stumbled, flailing, into the light of the Eye. This was a terrible plan! What possessed me to think running towards the light was a good idea? "Protect the Star!" they shouted as they launched themselves at my legs and arms, sinking their teeth into my flesh.\r\n\r\nIt was all I could do to shake them off in the water as I struck out for my boat, my crew watching in horror as the beasts clustered my limbs like fierce, furry leeches.</i>

The cavies rewarded me suitably on my return.</i>

The Seneschal murmured something into the King's ear, and he purred decisively.\r\n\r\n"To err is Murine; to forgive, Cavine." He looked towards the Chief Engineer. "If you will cede all right to Our Lady's Eye and help us place it back in its pool of holy pilgrimage - and if you agree to terms of tribute - "\r\n\r\n"Trade," hissed the Chief Engineer.

You throw the bloody prize at Mr Sacks' feet. It doesn't look down. "MORE," it booms.\r\n\r\nYou wake, a taste of copper in your throat. Your hand goes to your mouth; thankfully, your teeth remain.

>	Description	As soon as you dock, Mr Sacks lumbers ashore. It has been preparing for this.  Plunging a hand into its cloak, it removes a handful of ammonia-scented snow. It places it on the ground and adds another on the top. Into this one it presses the teeth and the hair from the small box.\r\n\r\nPotential. Substance. Only one thing needs to be added, as in the tales of the Nomen. The Crimson Beast of Winter waits impatiently for you to provide it.
>	Teaser	As soon as you dock, Mr Sacks lumbers ashore...
>>	Description	A few drops should suffice.
>>>	Description	You nick your hand with a blade and hold it above the frozen mound. A drop wells up and falls. More follow. They fizz in the lacre, which softens and melts into a puddle of snow; a puddle from which a hand emerges. Then a head. Then another hand; stretching as it clambers up from nowhere. The shape of a child; its skin glistening - white snow rippled with red.\r\n\r\nYou reach out a hand; the child grips it with the chill of frostbite. Its legs finally form from the last of the lacre and it falls to its new knees, shivering and looking around in confusion. One of your zailors hurries over with a warm blanket. Another smacks his idiot head.\r\n\r\nMr Sacks stares down at the creature, which shivers and hugs itself. "Inadequate," Sacks says. "Again." Striding to the sealed gate, it rests a gloved hand against it, basking in the chill.\r\n\r\n"The whisper of a place too cold for gods. Refreshing. Dispose of the mongrel as you see fit. Your Service is done. Be gone, before I change my mind." [Something new will shortly appear in your Lodgings]

You tip it carefully, dripping a few drops of the thick blood into the pile. They fizz in the lacre, which softens and melts into a puddle of snow. A hand emerges from it. Then a head. Then another hand; stretching, as it clambers up from nowhere. The twisted face of a gargoyle, rippled with red blood.\r\n\r\nIt screams. The monster throws its head back; blood wells in its hollow eyes, and drips down its half-formed face. The nascent arms explode into wings of shining ice, as sharp as any razor. It bends backwards, new hands clawing at its eyes. Just as abruptly as the scream began, it stops. The shape collapses, melts.\r\n\r\nMr Sacks looks away. "Another failure," it intones, stepping through the pile on its way to the Avid Horizon's sealed gates. It rests a gloved hand against it, basking in the chill. "The whisper of a place too cold for gods. Refreshing. Your Service is done. Be gone, before I change my mind." [Something new will shortly appear in your Lodgings]

Cigars, ashtrays, guillotines, matches and carved boxes are all for sale. Each step here transports you into a new realm: at one moment, the heady aroma of summer flowers; then, the earthy fug of fungus; the bitter warmth of morning coffee; the sickening sweetness of sweat and midnight honey.

One assistant holds an ear of corn (where did he find that down here?), another a stone jug, another a clay tablet. The elderly priest addresses them all to his congregation.\r\n\r\nYou catch snatches of it: "The Drowned Man is not a god." (The villagers hiss a reply.) "He came from the North, and to the North he will return." (Another reply.) "The North is too cold for gods." ("Too cold for gods," they intone delightedly.)\r\n\r\nFinally, they nod in agreement. The circle turns as one to grab one of their number, a man (or woman?) with a lamp. They carry him (or possibly her) to the precipice and hurl the flailing body over the edge, down into the oily black waves far below.\r\n\r\nTheir business done, the locals remove their robes and wander amiably back to town. They all seem quite jolly. Apparently the night's business went well. They retreat to the Cock and Magpie for a pint.

A table creaks beneath a lavish spread: bowls of plump ivory beans and peas as big as bullets. Golden potatoes, crunchy with fat. A vast roasting dish, in which a human carcass - trussed neatly with twine - sizzles in its juices. A Custodial Chef carves it like a Sunday roast. \r\n\r\n"Ah," he says, lifting his knife. "Regrettable timing. Capture them, brothers and sisters. We'll string them in the well, in anticipation of less fortunate times."

As you race through the twisting streets, a second troupe of locals descend from the well atop the hill. They are clad in white smocks and carry candles. They catch you in the flank, and you lose a Recalcitrant Lookout.\r\n\r\nYou are at the jetty when your Sprightly Deckhand - whose reputation outweighs his ability - falls to an expertly flung fishing net. The rest of you make it back to your ship and out to zee. You're still catching your breath when you spy an Admiralty frigate making for Quaker's Haven.

The cave was black as a vicar's cassock. The pool, when you stumbled into it, was cold as old teeth. Cupping your hands, you drank. The water was bitter, washing away the sweetness of the honey. \r\n\r\nYou wake, with a start, in the Once-Great Poet's chambers. Your mouth is full. Snatching an empty wine bottle from beside the chair, you spit a measure of silvery liquid into it. The Cheery Man's medicine. Back to London!

You sanded it smooth with handfuls of the chalky dust that carpeted the forest.\r\n\r\nWhen you stood to leave, your guide did not. "I mean to stay a while. You can find your own way back?" You left him in the company of the Promising Poet, laughing over a poor rhyme.\r\n\r\nYou awake in his lodgings, your hands empty. No cane. But the image of it is clear in your mind, and you know a shop in London where you might buy one just like it.

"Excellent. Now that you're here, [q:Addressed As], we can start. I'll just need a donation from the boy, and we'll have the last component. Could you help keep him still?"

At the Tobacconist's instruction, you firmly place your hands on the corners, holding taut the skin between the lines.\r\n\r\nThe Crotchety Tobacconist swiftly draws his scalpel across the Apprentice's flesh. The blade cuts easily, snagging only once or twice. Whenever it does, the Tobacconist readjusts the edge and gives it a sharp pull, slicing through the obstruction. The Apprentice pleads, but his screams go unheeded. Your hands and the Tobacconist's grow bloody, as you pinch and pull that patch of the Apprentice's flesh. And when the screams become distracting, the Tobacconist blows heavy smoke into his face - the Apprentice's eyes flutter shut. The Tobacconist grins and peels clean the skin he requires.\r\n\r\nAnd as he tends to the wrapping of the cigar, he oversees your preparations of a small tub of water. "We're going to test our beauty there."

You lie down on the workbench and the Tobacconist grasps your hands. "Thank you, [q:Addressed As]... Thank you. I cannot promise this will be quick, or painless; but it serves a most exquisite end. Now, I will have to restrain you. For your own safety, of course."\r\n\r\nFrom this angle, it's hard to see what the Tobacconist is doing: you have to go by sensation. He draws a line across your chest - the scalpel is sharp enough to tickle. Then he pinches and pulls, slices sideways across the fat. As the burning agony becomes unbearable, and your screams distracting, the Tobacconist blows a heavy smoke into your face. The purple lights flare, then go dark.\r\n\r\nYou are still lying on the bench when you wake. Your bonds have been removed and your chest is covered with a thick pinkening gauze. The Tobacconist is off to one side of the room, concentrating on a large tub on the floor.

Without hesitation, you snatch up the half-made cigar and toss it into the water. The binding breaks apart with the splash, and the filler spreads throughout the water. The Tobacconist drops his scalpel. He grabs at his heart; the fabric bunches in his clawed hand. With wobbling steps, he approaches the tub.

A floorboard creaks underneath him, and the Blemmigan turns around - the Tobacconist lunges toward it and drives the knife through its cap. He stabs it again and again.\r\n\r\nBy the end, his hands are stained red and purple. "D__n the - this isn't the quality we need," he says and sighs. "Let me be, [q:Addressed As].

Soon only the sharp crack of the hammer rings out. \r\n\r\nWhen they come down, the Apprentice and Tobacconist are covered in a pall of dust. The Apprentice's eyes are blood-shot, and his lashes greyed with powder. He coughs until he retches. The Tobacconist ignores him entirely. "It'll do," he says, grimly.

But about the population, you cannot offer as much detail. The Tomb Colonist declines to be identified and the travelling postman laughs at you.

"I won't say you've cheered up my First Mate, as we both know that can't be done! But you've come as close as anyone could."\r\n\r\nHe grimaces. "It's about that time," he says.

The powder is collected on mats and sieved into bottles. "Our export," the First Mate explains. "It goes to Station III. But that is not what we've come for."\r\n\r\nThe First Mate touches the spine, and for a time their spirit is absent. Then, from one of their few patches of unmarked skin, they grow a needle-shaped protrusion and snap it free. "A memento of what I saw when my mind was with Aigul."

An Unfinished Clay Man glares from within and growls as you begin removing planks. \r\n\r\nOnce you've opened it halfway, he roars and hurls his weight forward. The wood splinters, the box breaks - and he charges you into a workbench. Though you may have cracked a rib, you and the other two manage to wrestle him down onto the bench and subdue him. "That should have gone better," sneers the Tobacconist, kicking the leg of the bench. "But at least we've got it."

An Unfinished Clay Man glares from within and growls as you begin removing planks. \r\n\r\nOnce you've opened it halfway, he roars and hurls his weight forward. The wood splinters, the box breaks - and you sidestep his charge, letting him run directly into the workbench. From there, it's easy to bind him to the table with heavy chains. "Well dodged, [q:Addressed As]. Reminds me of when I was young and spry." His apprentice stifles a giggle.

>>>	Description	You spend hours reciting Rosegate's collections of Tennyson. Eventually, the Tobacconist stops by to see your progress. He takes your poem from his pocket and presses it against the glass. The Blemmigan bangs pitifully against the jar's lid. The Tobacconist sighs pink smoke. "Well, it was a worthy attempt. What's wrong with it? How can it not appreciate Tennyson?" He lifts the jar, and holds it tenuously by the lid. "I could smash you against the wall and stomp you into a pulp. But that would spoil our flavour." He sets the Blemmigan down. "On we go then, [q:Addressed As]."

Never mind the crew members who swore that they could hear every shriek and whimper of the divers you sent out into the corpse-water. And besides, from what you saw, there wasn't time for screaming. The dark slick gathered around their diving-suits, enfolding them like a cloak. You glimpsed one terror-contorted face through the glass of their helmet as they were bundled up in darkness, and then it was over. Only a little flotsam remained; the water was clear, as though the Neither had never been.

>>>	Description	Your ship's lamps sparked strange twinkles in the spreading remains of the Neither. When you looked closer, within the blackness you could see an unfamiliar sky, grasping trees, the cries of hostile birds. But now only clear water remains. The battle is over, isn't it? Of course. In any case, the thing is dead. Yes. You tear yourself from the porthole.

>>>	Description	You turn the lamps upon the spreading, undulating blackness of its carcass. You can hear the telltale sizzling sound through the hull. Something twinkles within the dark window of the Neither as it leaches away. The star-spread of a night sky, interrupted by a canopy of leaves. A far-off jungle; dark fruits and many-fingered figures sway in the trees. You tear yourself from the porthole, and when you look again, it is all gone. Only clear water remains, as through the Neither had never been.

>>>	Description	Everything is washed in light, though there is no sun. The air-water tastes of strawberries. The dancers are all around you. The pipes and the drum desire you to sing.

>>>	Description	You sing, and the Drownies around turn, arrested, to stare at you. They do not want to hear this song. The Cathedral beams creak, and you see that the buttresses are also the bones of a wrecked clipper. You recognise names inscribed by the door of the Crypt: an Admiralty woman lost at Zee, a well-known merchant. They are Drownies now, or parents of Drownies.

>>	Description	You're only here as a visitor. You don't need a place to stay.
>>>	Description	Water and air are the same thing here: a betrayal of nature, or a truce between opposites. Swim up the side of the Cathedral, if you like, and peer in through its rose windows. (You won't be able to make out anything inside.) Breathe deep. Fill your lungs with a substance cooler and more cleansing than ordinary air. Walk in the gardens with the fish around your knees. Do not ask questions about the King of this place: those will go unanswered.

>>>	Description	You cannot sing the song as well as its original singer, but it still captivates: the memory of seduction, the willingness to be seduced again, the glory of the Zee and its inhabitants. The air around you seems brighter than ever, the Drownies more beautiful. You fancy that the creatures of the surrounding Zee are gathering at the perimeter of Dahut to look in with wistful desire. In your song there are no pincers, no teeth, no calendars and no clocks.

>>>	Description	In a cluttered workshop, the Drownie Couturier copies fashion plates from London for the upper half of the garment. The set of the sleeves is as good as anything one could find at home. She takes pride in matching the weave of cloth, the buttons, the dyes and trim, so that nothing falls short of the original. As for the lower half, it swirls and floats as Drownie clothes do, though she has to modify her usual pattern in order to make it fit your legs. Not that there is anything wrong with that, she assures you.

The Cathedral lights from within, casting rose and gold and nile-green beams outwards from its windows. The effect is immediate. Far above, there is a shriek of tearing metal. It begins to rain in Dahut: parts of a metal hull, chunks of engine, drowned sailors from an Admiralty ship.\r\n\r\nYou are the first to reach one particular item of cargo.

>>>	Description	First they pretend not to have heard you speak, then they pretend not to know who you are talking about. Then they say that she was here, but that she has long since gone, and that of course she was never imprisoned. Then the story is that she was here, and she was imprisoned for trying to steal the mechanisms out of the Cathedral clock. Then it's that she died in the prison and there's no point looking for her now. All of these stories leave a shape in the middle, an outline of the unsaid truth.

>>>	Description	The more you look, the more you see that you are perhaps not intended to. The Cathedral's crypt is a prison. The graveyard is larger than it looks, and the bones are not all buried. The border between the breathable water and the dangerous water is not marked clearly; some have drowned in crossing over, leaving their possessions scattered on the zeefloor.

You write down the lyrics of a few of the songs.

Only a few spots are proper homes for your Blemmigan.\r\n\r\nYou set it in its place. It is truly bright and sets off the false colour of the Drownie blossoms and the Drownie fish. The flowers that grow here natively are red and gold and orchid-purple, but they fade to drab if you look at them from the corner of your eye.

You hear sobbing, and the names of lost sweethearts, and expressions of anger. You hear regrets over decisions taken poorly. Today your fascination with Dahut does not increase.
>>>	Teaser	If you stand at the bottom of the stairs and listen at the Crypt-gate, you hear sounds that do not come from the dead...
>>>	Name	The staircase under the Cathedral
>>>	Description	It leads down, but it's hard to see where it goes. There are plaques to past Drownies, but the words do not hold their meaning from one moment to the next. There is a gate of latticed iron, tinged with rust. Beyond the gate, the water is murky and dim.

>>>	Description	Ostrich steaks, seared on each side. Green herbs. Wedges of fruit that, even on the Surface, would grow far to the south. You have not eaten like this since... have you ever had such a meal? It is enough to drive away many past fancies and disturbing dreams. 
>>>	Teaser	Ostrich steaks, seared on each side...
>>>	Name	How lovely it is
>>>	Description	There is a rhyme to tell you the safe from the unsafe, but how does it go? Eat the fruit, disdain the root? Chewy lump, something-something dump?\r\n\r\nEven if you remembered perfectly, the food defies categorisation. The potato mash enclosed in lemon rind. The cakes that bleed cinnamon syrup in the water-air. The cocoa-dusted crab, which is not the kind of chewy intended by the poem. Probably. But soon you're too full to think about these matters.

>>>	Description	The bonfire is not a bonfire, but a sulphurous rent in the zee floor. The dancers are not dancing, but are drifting back and forth, so many corpses in a fickle current. The whole place is a play, a jest for the King of Drownies, a parody of the Surface.

Sometimes a pair will break off and depart into the shadows. \r\n\r\nThe fire may be a phantom, imaginary flames in air fashioned from water. But the mutual affection of the Drownies is not entirely a performance.

>>>	Name	Flags of light
>>>	Description	When you extend your hand to the flames, they grow warmer, but not hot enough to burn or scald. The sensation is like dipping your hand into a cup of tea. Seeing your experiments, one of the Drownies makes a gesture. Three of them together push you fully into the bonfire. Your hair is crackling, and something like smoke is rising from your clothes, but when you scramble out again you feel whole just as before.

>>>	Name	Flickering
>>	Name	Observe the Bonfire
>>>	Description	There is a great water-bonfire. It does not crackle or smoke as a real fire might. But it is bright and hot, and it turns the Unterzee night into a warm bath. The flames ripple up gradually, in majesty, because they are made of water. And when the Drownies see you watching, they catch your hands and pull you towards the dance, into a current you cannot fight.
>>>	Teaser	There is a great water-bonfire...
>>>	Name	Gathering outside the Cathedral
>>>	Description	The log tells of a ship saved by Dahut. The Zubmarine had been attacked and badly damaged; the fuel was nearly gone; they were being followed by something that tapped arrhythmically on their hull. The crew were too terrified to speak. When they emerged into the sunny-seeming gardens of Dahut, and swam to greet their hosts, they thought they had already died. The beast following them could be seen circling the spire of the Cathedral, but the Drownies said it could not trespass on the confines of Dahut and that there was nothing to fear.

>>>	Name	Another visitor's tale
>>	Description	It might shed some light, or it might not. [The Log's effect on your Clarity and Enthralment is at the whim of fate.]
>>>	Description	The log tells of a harrowing stay in Dahut: the writer could not see the enthralling visions of the Cathedral and the rose garden that fascinated all of her shipmates. The Drownies dragged her into the Cathedral Crypt and secured her there so that she could tell no one what she saw. There she remained for many months. Now and then new prisoners arrived. Occasionally the Drownies would take a few prisoners out to be turned into Drownies themselves. But she remained, unable to leave, until one of the Drownies took pity on her and left a key in her reach.
>>>	Teaser	The log tells of a harrowing stay in Dahut: the writer could not see the enthralling visions of the Cathedral and the rose garden that fascinated all of her shipmates...
>>>	Name	Another visitor's tale
>>>	Description	The log rhapsodises about a visit to Dahut: the foods, the dances, the affection and beauty of the Drownies, the roses that grow to the size of cabbages, the herds of fish. 'I would have stayed there all my life, except that my First Mate was afraid of the food in that place and refused to eat it. She pressed me again and again to take her somewhere else before she starved. So finally I agreed to take her away to another place, always intending to go back to Dahut... but my Zubmarine being damaged in the voyage, I could not return...'

Food that looked like fruit but tasted like flesh; the disappearance of several crew members, without leave or explanation; the scent of mildew coming off a bonfire; a creaking noise from the Cathedral roof, and shouts from its Crypt; an obscure Liturgy involving a Bishop Drownie in cream-coloured robes.\r\n\r\nNow you consider it, you have smelled some of these smells, and tasted some of these tastes, even if you dismissed them at the time.

You are special, welcome, adored. If you think you have heard a strange human voice  now and then, it is just a memory from your life before.

She sees you and raises both hands in a peculiar double wave, because, as you see, her wrists are cuffed together. She smiles at you and then the light shifts and you can no longer see into her cell.

>>>	Description	Before you can investigate, you have to remember that you're underwater, because the illusion is so strong that it is tempting always to walk on the ground. But you can swim up to the clock face on the Cathedral, close enough to see the tertiary dial. You should bring a good lamp, because even when there is sunlight elsewhere in Dahut, it never illuminates this part of the clock. If you do that, you can see dials that indicate today's dates: one hand pointing to December, one to June, and a stubby shorter hand pointing to the last of October. That hand is growing longer.

The impellers whirr. The pistons race. She's eager for the Wilderness. \r\n\r\nThe Sharp Driver salutes as she enters. "Cargo's loaded." What are you lugging this time? She adjusts her smoked goggles, and fakes a barker's effusive tones: "Murgatroyd's Inestimable Frontier Supplies. Affordable, reliable - a taste of Old London!" You both pull faces.

You blink; it's always startling, how blue her eyes are. She rubs her neck, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nHow do you know that gesture? There was another time - another place, before?

She passes you one. The fungal smell hits your nose. You decline. The Driver laughs. \r\n\r\n"Blame the Empress. I hear she's got a taste for them. Wouldn't let the manufacturer stay behind." She sits on a box stamped with the logo of the Murgatroyd Company. "God bless her Enduring Majesty," she proclaims, with another crunch. "Without her we'd just be two girls stuck back down there in the dark and the damp." Overhead, an amber borealis writhes in a sunless sky.

Now, precisely now, you choose to see things as they are: the strained hope on its still-lovely face; the beetroot, prehensile anatomy below. \r\n\r\nSeeing that you are no longer in thrall, your lover pulls a floating silk across its thighs. "No one has woken in the middle before," it says. And: "It wasn't a lie, but a different seeing." Then it withdraws from you, shaking and unsteady. On a rock it deposits a pile of coral-coloured eggs.

What their life was like before. How they yearn for the approval of the Fathomking, and how all of Dahut works to earn his blessing.

'Oh, my beloved has gone to Dahut, and I must rescue her!' If that's what you wanted, you could have just asked, but this way you have an excuse for dallying with a Drownie first. What will you tell her? 'I didn't want to, dearest, and it gave me a shudder to do it, but I had to, just to get you back.'"\r\n\r\nYou open your mouth, but your lover isn't finished. "You people say we're liars and deceivers, but we're only giving a little extra colour to what's already in your mind. You wanted to be here, whatever you tell yourself. And so does she! If someone is in prison in Dahut, it's her own doing. The walls are only there if you have a mind to view them."

We don't force them to stay, but they aren't able to go."\r\n\r\nWhen you part, your stay in Dahut is at an end, but your lover lets you keep a few sharp memories of the place, as a parting gift.

>	Description	All the Drownies are gathered. You do not belong here, since you are still human, but they do not keep you out. Where the altar should be, there is a square depression in the floor: it would be a pool, were the Cathedral not already submerged. A Drownie in a mitre presides.
>	Teaser	All the Drownies are gathered...
>>	Description	You know their songs, both solemn and joyous. You know your own stories to weave into those songs.
>>>	Description	You take your place in the song. It is easier to understand once you are inside it. The words are clear, and so is the import of the music.\r\n\r\nThe Fathomking is not here. The Fathomking did not grace Dahut with his attendance this time. It has been many Liturgies since he last watched over the Drownies of Dahut from the pool at the front of the Cathedral. They have done their best to entice him, collecting objects and people and remains of eminent beings. But he remains in his Hold. This is why they are so anxious, why their feasts are not sustaining. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, it is still the Liturgy of Souls. Like the Drownies, you descend into the square pool and bow your head before the Bishop. The Cathedral bells strike the time: midsummer, midwinter, equinox. For the length of the triple peal, you are aware of every past extreme simultaneously: the moments of greatest courage, doubt, longing, fury, pain.\r\n\r\n"It's all true," says the Bishop. Then he slaps you hard on the cheek and pulls you out of the pool. Your body feels differently weighted, but unharmed. Possibly even better than it did before.

There is no place for you here. They have other drownings to perform.\r\n\r\nWhen you reach your ship again, you find the Lady hiding in the rocks nearby. "I was on my way to Rosegate," she says. "I beg you'll give me passage. Did my composer friend send you? I thought I recognised the tune. He always said he had a song in mind that could have gotten us both out of there, if only he could concentrate long enough. It was good of him to send you, though... oh dear. I'm not in love with him. Do you think that's what he was after? I just want to finish the voyage I was on... Forgive me! I don't usually talk so much, but it has been a long silence in that prison."

As for the inhabitants who are sharp throughout their full bodies, they don't circulate much. There is said to be a cavern, broad and shallow-floored, where the perfectly sharp grow old together. They aren't capable of anyone else's company any more — at least, that's what you're told, and you can hardly go and ask. At any rate they are more like growing crystals than like people, slowly expanding and bonding with the rock.

>>>	Description	They name their offerings in turn. A Thousand Helping Fingers for my Neighbour; The Miracle that Brought Me Here; Deportment.\r\n\r\nYou show the dwellers of Hideaway your offering. It was difficult with the limited materials, but you've managed to give the lump of meat and guts a passing resemblance to the shape of Temtum. They seem pleased, but more impressed by your skill with their sign language - you manage to convey that Temtum is important even to you, a stranger.\r\n\r\nYour offering is the last to go down the offering chute. The Suggester gestures their wish for the good health of all, Temtum most especially. The people of Hideaway take this as their cue and depart.

>>>	Description	As the procession marches to the chute, you turn and walk back to your zubmarine. Someone taps you on the shoulder. The Near-Forgotten Betrayer, cradling a bloodied, child-sized Temtum meat-doll, speaks in over-enunciated English: "Do you not know?  It is time to give Temtum your offering." Perhaps she thinks you did not understand the gestured instructions. You only nod and continue on your way.

>>>	Description	You fill your mouth with the foul, dyed water. Your fellow diners spit it out in a spray; you follow suit. When the rainbow clears, the tables - not to mention you and your fellow diners - are covered in colour. The green-lipped Philosopher holds her stomach but forces a smile; the Mercenary grins at everyone down the table, showing off his indigo stained teeth.

>>	Description	A bell rings. The Conscientious Mercenary licks his lips and begins carving a squelching, squirming fish. The Sallow Philosopher performs the gesture of good digestion, before forcing down a bite.
>>>	Description	You carve into your dinner: a fish, whose identifying traits have been lost to the layers of pigment caked onto it. As you carve off a bite, its mouth flaps open. Cosmogone dye trickles out. It might be tasty, if the meat weren't as chewy as gum, and if you couldn't feel the dyes colouring your intestines; hopefully you're fond of blue.

>>>	Description	The Conscientious Mercenary looks at you meaningfully and cups his cheeks: the gesture of plenty. He slices you a lobe of the shark's brain, and licks the violant jelly from the blade when done. He considers the eyes carefully, before he places one on your plate. He adjusts it to look up at you.\r\n\r\nYour first bite of the brain, and the taste spreads through your mouth like ivy. The eye is no better. It pops in your mouth, bursting into stinking jelly.

>>>	Description	They gasp, their tongues stained gaudy colours. The Conscientious Mercenary snatches the heart from the table and takes a defiant bite. He performs the gesture of "thanking someone for passing food," before turning back to his own dessert. The rest of the table resumes a few moments later, though any relish they'd had in their food is gone. No one even comments when the Sallow Philosopher quietly bundles her serving of kidneys into a handkerchief. She signs you good health and - mouthing a silent "I can't stand it," - passes you the bundle.

>>>	Description	You must have been dancing for a few hours now, but it just goes on. The only relief from the quiet is the irregular clap from the Master of the Dance. The great chain of dancers weaves through the crowd without a noise. There are formerly holy teachers; once monarchs; warriors without battles; short-changed merchants - a growing and ceaseless parade. Some move with grace, others only sway in their steps out of obligation. The spool continues to unreel.

>>>	Description	Eventually, the Master claps at you, and you bite the ribbon and take your place. Shortly thereafter, the spool unwinds completely. There is a modest bang, and the air fills with fluttering papers. On each, a resident of Hideaway has written their secret. The dancers fall on them in a frenzy. You snatch as many as you can.\r\n\r\nThe one whose mercy led to colonial establishment. The seller of names. The one whose theories on Is-Not proved too dangerous. The one who stormed the city - what's this? The name is too smudged to read.

>>	Description	The people look like they're on the edge of miserable tears. And who wouldn't be, dancing in this awful quiet? Give them a song!
>>>	Description	The Master of the Dance almost lets out a shout; the ribbon falls from his mouth. A few dancers curl their lips and step from the line. The Master clears his throat, and signs - with trembling hands - the closing of the festival. He thanks the people of Hideaway for the celebration of unity, and thanks Temtum for their home. The crowd responds with silent applause. Here and there, you spot a few thanking you with secretive smiles. One even pushes something into your hand: a small token of thanks.

>>>	Description	Nook was founded by those fleeing the tyranny of above zee regimes. It is now the nexus of all the Unterzee's illicit trades, and is home to a few rich but paranoid captains of commerce. The wealthy live in fortified mansions cut into the upper rings. The minor traders and dockhands live deeper down, in the cramped lower rings of the Cavities.These workers also tend the oxygenating plantlife that grows in the gaps between their homes. \r\n\r\nBeneath the Cavities there is only the Gullet. It is lightless, and unsounded. No one has returned from exploring its depths. Occasionally it shifts, shaking the city. Nook-dwellers are accustomed to minor tremors.

She will destroy us!" \r\n\r\nAs if on cue, the whole city shifts around you. The crowd erupts in shouts of fear. The figure in a hemp mask produces a small vial and crushes it in his fist. A cloud of ink engulfs him, then he is gone. No! There he is - darting down a narrow tunnel which leads towards the Cavities.\r\n\r\nThe Debonair Deductress appears at your shoulder.

>>>	Description	Nookers rarely venture close to the Gullet. It's not just because of superstitious dread; a near irresistible current sucks down it, pulling food, refuse and the unwary into the depths of the Maw. Only strong swimmers can escape it. \r\n\r\nStill, the current renders your swim downwards swift. After several minutes the ever-murkier water is abruptly lit by hundreds of glowing, tethered eels. They light a vast cut in the wall. Mechanical workings dig into the red Maw-flesh beyond.

>	Description	A tall tooth has been carved into a spiralled cone. It is ringed with delicate patterns, each band representing a stratum of Nook society. It is an honest depiction of the population. The lowest band is oppressively intricate, with hooks and blades gouged into its design. The pinnacle is unmarred and highly polished. The elite find life smooth-living, here. \r\n\r\nToday the shrine seems popular. Is this piety caused by the constant shaking of the ground, or are the Nookers a devout group?

>>>	Description	"Our ancestors entered the Maw fleeing tyranny, with nothing but the sacred knives they held in their teeth. Their enemies left them to their fates, assuming that none could survive in this deepest, darkest, sharpest of crevices. Yet, here in the mouth of providence, they prospered, and we continue to thrive in the Maw's sacred rumination." The sermon over, offerings are loaded into a crate and floated up to the very top of the temple, weighted down, and then pushed out into open water, to fall eventually down into the belly of the Maw. For an instant, a vision overcomes you: you are swimming through the open Zee, dwarfing creatures and reefs alike. The stars are visible through miles of water above. The vision is gone; you are left feeling suddenly, ludicrously small.

"But is there any wonder she stirs, when ingrates plot against her? Speak of <i>killing</i> her? That Hempen Man leads our people astray, drags them down into his cult."  \r\n\r\nBut has this Hempen Man led the children away? Are they among his devotees?\r\n\r\n"<i>I</i> don't know.

He laughs, and slaps his mahogany thigh. "Yes, That's Rosina. I am glad she lives yet, though I wouldn't wish her fate on anyone. Not even myself. Oh, I've paid my price for choices made long ago, and more. But there's no justice where there can be no atonement. That's why I founded this place," he says, looking around at the enamel walls of Nook. "Only the zee's justice here. That is my punishment. That and this, of course," and he shows you the hand he conceals. Not a hand; dozens of pale, translucent cilia undulate in the water. "At least the eels have no taste for me anymore," he says.

The number of urchin spines you accumulated in the back of your hand determines your share of the pot, and it is surprisingly rich pickings. Not bad for a beginner.

>>>	Description	You begin to wonder whether the whole game is a prank. Or worse, a <i>satire</i>. The other players confidently cite rules and regulations that keep you at the bottom of the table. But surely the requirement that all sixes be under-rolled contradicts the <i>en passant</i> rule? \r\n\r\n"That's the game," one Nooker shrugs. "You'd think a bubble-mouth would understand that life's not fair." The rest chuckle, and split your stake. At least the loser ends up spending the least time with the eel.

"For my sister. Last I heard she was on Anthe," he says, handing you the letter. "I've been breathing Nook water too long; I can't venture out into the Empty, not anymore." He leans back. "Chances are she'll tear it up. I would. But promise me, one way or another you'll tell her I'm sorry."

>>>	Description	At this level the game adds in a bewildering array of spiny dice and three extra sets of cards. Turn order depends on the day of the week. But there is <i>always</i> the eel. \r\n\r\nAnd that is your undoing. Apparently the correct reaction to a mid-game argument about the scale-colour of the eel was to declare the manoeuvre void, because the players involved were playing adjacently, not orthogonally.

>>>	Description	It is a bold attempt, but the eel proves uncooperative. It escapes when you try to shift the box widdershins, and soon dice and players are scattering in every direction. Apparently, this alone would be a winning move, but you forgot to declare a carryover before you did it, so all bites are void. The other players grin while ducking the enraged eel. "That's Snaplamprey, for you," one says. "Better luck next time!"

Those silly Nookers must be exaggerating. It's probably just a couple playing hide-and-seek. That makes far more sense." \r\n\r\nThe Maw shudders; its teeth groan together.

Swim too fast, and they'll tire - and find an easier target. Swim too slow, and you'll be overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nYou over-emphasise your ungainly Trespasser swimming style. The mob is hooked. "We're going to throw you in the Gullet, Trespasser!" The rest of what they shout is incoherent with rage. Swim. Swim faster. \r\n\r\nToo close.

Most of their clothes have rotted away to nothing or been discarded with the rest of their old lives. The oldest of them sit like statues around the pool. Thick layers of salt armour their desiccated skin.

You are amongst your own.\r\n\r\nThe more lucid of the Old Zailors reach out. Their withered hands gently relieve you of your heavy belongings and help you out of your suffocating clothes.

Hours later. Perhaps days. The cold air of the Gant Pole prickles your bare skin. Your fingertips burn. Handwritten text glimmers in the darkness, not all of it legible.

The metal shape is colossal in the confined space, its exterior still shiny despite, presumably, years beneath the zee. You lean over to look inside. The clapper is covered in a dark residue.

You cannot let go! Your feet lift off the ground and the walls flash past as you are yanked <i>inside</i> the bell-\r\nYou are light, all of you. The sun that turns; the touch that burns. The voice of fires and falling spires. The wheel within the wheel within the wheel, contemplating, constructing, consuming. Each click of the cog, the circles colliding and guiding-\r\n\r\nYou struggle free, and fall. The impact of your body on the cold floor slams breath back into your lungs.

The vergers cannot resist explaining to you why that would not work, with reference to pressure differentials and stress points. Behind you, the Parson slips into the bell tower.\r\n\r\nYou step back inside just in time to see him seize the bell rope with both hands and give an almighty pull. BONG! His expression of fascination is replaced by wide-eyed terror as the rope hauls him at breathtaking speed up the tower and inside the bell. There is a brief scream; a damp crunch. Coins shower you, along with a bracing drizzle of gore.\r\n\r\nYou won't be collecting a second fare from the Wandering Parson. But he had a surprising amount of pocket change.

Some of Wrack's citizens were educated before they sank. And, of course, you can learn much from tether-visions.\r\n\r\nThe King smiles, and smooths his shirt. "A straightforward affair.

A triumphal arch of blazing Mountain-stone has been constructed across the docks, the words 'DEATH HATH NO MORE DOMINION' engraved across it. \r\n\r\nThe streets are lit by steady electric lights, of the kind seen in the Khanate. But the priest-officials you can make out sermonising to the dockside crowds wear white robes, like those popular in the Presbyterate. Hunched over the rooftops is the clawing outline of the Bazaar: a blasted ruin.\r\n\r\nAs you watch, your reflection issues orders. Crewmen - also nimble with preternatural health - hurry to obey. The guns on deck swivel, to train on the great arch...\r\n\r\nThe Fair King's voice interrupts the vision. "I am never sure what it is we are seeing. The gentleman's hopes? His fears?

The Man reads it and passes the young woman a flask. Before her crewmates can set on her, she has drained it. Her skin glows with new vigour. And before they can set on him, he laughs, and - in the spirit of liberty, equality, and eternity - gives them each a flask of their own. \r\n\r\nThe Fair King's voice interrupts the vision.

You remember the days; you humble his more boastful recollections, and he puffs his cheeks as he always did. As you wait for dinner, he turns over his fork and wonders how much longer it will be.

The thing that emerged had his brother's voice."

Your search uncovers neither reward nor peril. \r\n\r\nA crewman expels a stream of bubbles - in relief?

Her greatcoat is still on her chair, an olive-green water-damaged journal poking from the left pocket. \r\n\r\nBack on the zubmarine, you read what little remains legible. A defection was intended, to the 'New Sequence.' 'I want only to remember the sun,' she wrote, 'the sun, the sun, the sun.' An ambition thwarted by the zee.

A corridor stretches before you, and here is what's left of the vessel's crew.\r\n\r\nTwo neatly-placed lines of skulls face each other. Their eye sockets and jaws have been caulked closed with something resinous. Your diving gear is awkward. Your foot disturbs a skull; it rolls on its side, and you see it's sealed underneath. \r\n\r\nA cracking sound. The skull rocks, this time without your help. Another dull crack. Its parietal bone breaks, drifts away. From inside something uncoils, black and glistening, centipedal, trimmed with writhing cilia. It gropes towards you, unwinding to shoulder height - how did all that fit inside a skull?\r\n\r\nAnother crack from behind you. Another. You flee, as the skulls begin to hatch.

Something shivers against your thigh.\r\n\r\nYou are separated from your crew. A wrong turning between two ballasts; you find yourself in a corridor piled high with skulls, neatly stacked against the bulkheads. Over the eye sockets and mouths, a black resin like olive paste has dried. Every grin is stained as though by red wine; between the teeth dark waxy strings like melted cheese cling.\r\n\r\nA hand on your shoulder - the engineer. "Only old bones, captain."

The wood of the deck is blistered and scorched by old gunfire. \r\n\r\nBelow decks, the cabins show evidence of a slaughter. Old stains coat the walls. The blood must have dried before the ship sank. In the third cabin you reach, a white-eyed woman, her skin bloated, gnaws on a comrade's severed hand. Strings of gristle cling to her teeth. She looks up, uncomprehending. Your first officer cleaves her head from her shoulders.

It describes how he insisted that he be allowed into the cargo hold. Of a pitched battle that ensued when he wasn't. Dried stains underfoot tell the rest. The hold remains secure. \r\n\r\nBreaking it open, you discover a box of bone carvings providing an description of the Chelonate's great turtle and an account of its death. According to this account, the turtle was not hunted - as the Chelonates claim - but was already dead when they found it.\r\n\r\n[You could deliver the bone carvings to Scrimshander.]

It illuminates a shoal of fish skirting around and away from the wreck. The cargo hold is yawning wide, offering easy entrance.\r\n\r\nYour bo'sun is to remain outside while the rest of you go in.

They called themselves the Seven." She does not sound entirely disapproving. \r\n\r\n"My husband shielded me from the details of his endeavour, although I have made a number of suppositions. I know for certain, however, that it ended in disaster. He and his co-conspirators fled beneath the waves. If you could find him, he may be able to lead you to the others."\r\n\r\n"If you locate him, please give him this," she hands you a locket containing a miniature portrait of herself.

The world is unjust. If only it were possible to do more, you intimate. Charity, after all, can only mitigate the symptoms of tragedy, not prevent it. \r\n\r\nThe Philanthropist peers at you. "What are you getting at?" You allow her to coax it from you with the application of sherry. Though she knew the rough shape of her husband's former endeavour, this is the first time she has heard the full story. Now it's all she has left of him, she is hungry for it. She leans forwards, cheeks flushed, eyes dark.\r\n\r\nYou debate and quarrel and conspire all through the night. As the servants are beginning to rouse, she shakes your hand with a fierce grip.

"The only strange tongue I speak is my mother's, which is ancient but human. Blades can cut me. I'm not immune to fire (though perhaps the Masters are not either). But I have not met anyone who shares my particular skills. And I know my mother. I cannot see her in any ordinary liaison with an ordinary man, much less a husband. She was in her third millennium when she bore me."

>>>	Description	She asks what you want removed. Then she makes you consent three times to having it taken away.\r\n\r\nThen, the blade. There's pain in your ear, yes, but that is not the chief sensation. The other thing is a noise and a resistance like shears through heavy cloth. It is located in your mind and at the back of your neck. Your eyes go black.\r\n\r\n"I haven't blinded you," she says mildly, as you sit there blinking and swallowing. "But it will feel for a time as if I had. You lost a great deal of light."

>>>	Name	Box delivered to the surgery
>>	Name	Let her have her experiment
>>>	Description	She refuses to let you watch while she works on the contents of the box. But afterward, she is in a dark mood, and complains in generalities. People are fools. No one dares face up to what is wrong with them. Hiding a secret from yourself does not make it go away. Pretending anger doesn't exist is not the same thing as patience. \r\n\r\nWhatever operation she's just done, she's kept a souvenir from it, but she won't show anyone what it is. She wraps it in cotton wool and keeps it in a little lacquered box left over from the sale of tea.

>>>	Description	No no no.\r\n\r\nYou must be jealous of her history. You must be trying to manage her for yourself. You must have been using her for the Cladery Heart all along. She has no more use for you. People like her can make their fortunes anywhere. \r\n\r\nYou don't see her go, but when you check the ship in the morning, she has gone. Overboard? Did she swim? However she went, she took her knives and her specimens with her.

>>>	Name	No
>>	Name	Push her about meeting her father
>>>	Description	Her mother is not the concubine of a Master. Her father will never bring her knife-steel tempered in a baby star. Her lineage is merely human. Her city is only the mortal city that first fell into the Bazaar. She must give up waiting for an unimaginable future to blossom of its own accord.\r\n\r\nThe two of you speak about it late into the night, and then she goes into her operating room with a scalpel and a mirror. \r\n\r\nWhen she comes out, she has her small toe preserved in a whiskey jar, and a happy indifference to the question of her parentage.

"Did you know my mother operated on the Bazaar itself? She cut away its cladent lobe so that it would be at peace and not have to wander on and on. But the operation changed her. She got some of the ichor on her skin." [To acquire a Cladery Souvenir, you must find something for the Heir to operate on.

Two apologies, in fact. \r\n\r\nThe first is for conducting an affair with the recipient's cousin, 'Rosina'. The second is for a military blunder.

>>>	Description	There is a King who sees a city which delights him.  He longs to rule it, though it can never be his. But he is unperturbed: he may have a fantasy of the city, and that is enough to satisfy his whim. \r\n\r\nNo power in the zee cared to stop the city from rising, and so the King populates it with subjects at his discretion. They live in a phantom reality: one that is beautiful enough to disguise its truth.

>>	Description	Travellers of all eras from across the Neath have been brought here to rest. Perhaps something can be synthesised from their collections.
>>>	Description	It was said that a flower in the zee grew within the zee, one that any true lover would pluck for their beloved. If nothing else, it was a proof of bravery, devotion, and diving talent - all conventionally attractive qualities. \r\n\r\nMany dived, most died: but a few found the flower, and found that it was not what they expected. It was beautiful beyond their imagining. And though a pretty poetic conceit had send them below, it was not enough to bring them back up. They abandoned their old lovers, in death or for beauty.

>>	Description	Both its walls and the statues are made from the near-black bones of zee-beasts.
>>>	Description	You examine a sculpture. It shows two gentlemen - one of the Khanate, the other European - and a woman of the Elder Continent. They are leaning together, their foreheads touching; the lower halves of the figures are unfinished. Next, you come across a quartet of statues - begun, then abandoned - of a narrow, bespectacled man. His features are subtly different in each attempt, as if the sculptor was trying to get them right. MEMORY LIES is inscribed upon the base of the last of them.\r\n\r\nAnd here: a kingly man of the Presbyterate, pierced with arrows and sinking to one knee. Is this the Presbyter himself? He is crowned, and carries a set of tablets. Upon one is written 'THE PRESTER SAITH: none shall live a thousand years'. On another, less neatly, is inscribed 'THIS HISTORY WAS WRITTEN BY THE LOSERS' \r\n\r\nYou hear a woman's voice, echoing through the tunnels. "Healer, Schemer, Soldier, Guide. Propagandist, Financier and Captain. Rosina, myself, Batuk, Lorenzo. Bourdain, Lytton and Arik." You follow the voice, but it fades into the maze-like tunnels. You help yourself to a memento: a perfect apple carved from the the blue-black bone, and depart.\r\n\r\n

>>>	Description	Every bone of the midnight whale is intact, and every inch has been densely carved with words. The writing appears to be Greek, in an ancient script, but you recognise the carvings all bear the same hand. The work must have taken the author years. Decades.\r\n\r\nThe base of the whale's skull bears a crude portrait. You've seen this man and his immaculate beard before. No wonder he's so quick to laugh at the historical plays far above.

>>>	Description	The repository is filled with statues carved from the same black bone as the walls, the ceiling, the floor. This statue exults over the body of a fallen foe; this one drags itself up a shingled slope; this one is a child with the bleak eyes of an old man. The floor is carpeted in thick, dark bone-dust. \r\n\r\nYou move deeper into the serried population of statues. Wait - that one is not a statue - it's a woman, observing you with peligin eyes.

>>>	Description	Her knife grazes your shoulder as you flee, but she is content to let you escape. The wet work of a flensing knife echoes through the hallways behind you. Apparently not all monks in Scrimshander are content to let history find victims at its own pace.

>>	Description	Water presses against the airlock door. The breathing and slithering of the beast gives it the rhythm of a drumbeat.
>>>	Description	You don your heavy diving suit and give the order to cycle the airlock. Water rushes in and you begin the slow swim down into the port. It soon becomes obvious that you are over-dressed for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe people of Nook swim and breathe in the cloudy Maw-water with no apparent discomfort. Most are naked, with just a few clad in rotten rags that stream from their skin with no concern for modesty.\r\n\r\nNone will communicate with you, if they even can. Those who acknowledge your presence just laugh silently at your bulky suit and unnecessary air-hose. You'll need a different approach.

Your lungs burn, holding in that last gulp of air; your legs thrash. You can't hold it in. It escapes! You're choking on water. It forces its way into your lungs, the taste of burning salt suffocating every attempt to gasp, scream or-\r\n\r\nThen, through the exhaustion and panic, you realise you're breathing. It's hard work. Your lungs fight against the weight. But it's enough. You can tolerate it, at least for now.\r\n[The liberal application of wine will make this process easier - in future, bring a cask.]

>>>	Description	Again, you remove your clothes and put them safely in the watertight diving suit compartment. As the water rushes in, you are ready; taking gulps to speed the transition. It feels less like drowning, now, and more like baptism. You swim into Nook with skin and mind tingling, reborn in the airlock's cold steel.

Thrashing bodies float and press against the polished walls, with convenient water currents removing the worst of the effluence.\r\n\r\nThough most Nookfolk take full advantage of their three dimensions of movement to explore and indulge, many are willingly tied to the point of immobility in spider-silk and even salvaged wire. Their skin glows with hues of blue and purple.
>	Teaser	A huge tooth hosts this ongoing orgy...
>>	Description	She bites her lip, long hair streaming behind her head.
>>>	Description	Her tongue presses eagerly against yours. She stops you from floating away by digging her ragged fingernails into your cheeks. Her writhing body wraps around yours with the slippery finesse of an eel. She drags you down, deeper into the tooth, and then deeper into her embrace. When all is done, she kisses you gently on your forehead. Her eyes do not leave yours as she lifts your wrist to her mouth. She bites down - sharply, firmly, gently - suckling at the warm blood.

>>>	Description	The Gentleman goes to work. The thin silk bites into your arms and legs as he tightens knots. No touch is more than a brush; an unfulfilled promise of more. Red pain spreads from under the bonds. Never does his kiss reach your lips. Your limbs ache and tingle; there is anguished freedom in such constraints. Your body shakes - with pain, or pleasure. Pleasure, certainly, when the evening ends and the bonds are finally cut free.

Someone in the writhing mess of bodies drops spider-silk rags thick enough to blindfold. These are employed immediately. The anonymity is liberating, the pleasure unconstrained by gravity or propriety. The moment is prolonged.

>>>	Description	You stamp through the close, confining corridors. The air tickles intolerably at your throat, and you rasp like a cat with a furball. Crewmen scurry from your path.

Impossible - making tea would be a logistical impossibility.\r\n\r\nYet the inhabitants seem content. Many have come here from London, the Khanate, the Presbyterate; abandoning cultured life for this tenuous existence. They grin, their mouths full of stolen flesh, or float naked and carefree.

They carry bone knives, or tooth-tipped spears.\r\n\r\nA few gesture to you - in welcome? Invitation? It is unclear. The slightly glutinous water makes speech impossible, so the natives have developed a language of signs. You can interpret the most basic: a finger pulled across a throat, for example, is one of the more polite invitations to depart.

A bit of floating scrap, just sharp enough, slices through the flesh and exposes the soft tissue behind.\r\n\r\nYou slide your legs into the warm meat and sinew, trying not to gag on the sudden rush of blood. The muscle clamps shut around your legs and chest.

You savour their fear instead, as you lick what used to be your arm; the bone carved into a sharp blade. Blood in the water. There is always blood in the water. No longer yours. Soon, theirs.

The lead weights have caught in the bend, and the corpses - tugged by the current - strain on their end of their tethers.\r\nThese deeper, acidic waters have eaten at them. The oldest are just corpse-stubs, now, while the newest are still mostly wrapped.

I'm just- " His hand tightens on the railing.\r\n\r\nThe Drownie Postman stares up at you both. It's natural for corpses to grimace; but when the corpse is still alive, and is actively upset at you, it is additionally distressing.

>	Description	The cavern is crowded. In the center is a bathtub full of ice, in which sits a woman in an obvious state of illness. Several Antheans attend her, one with deft, clear fingers. Then there are a number of other people attending, who mostly talk among themselves, but sometimes turn to watch Rosina.
>	Teaser	The cavern is crowded...
>>	Description	The light and gloom might counteract one another. Would this hasten Rosina's animescence, or slow it?
>>>	Description	Rosina braces herself in the ice bath and prepares for the Song. You cannot replicate exactly how it sounds in the air-water of Dahut, but its contradictions come through clear enough. It is hard to take either joy or sorrow too seriously, if you believe the Song. \r\n\r\n"I feel positively indifferent," Rosina says afterwards. It is a compliment.

>>>	Description	Rosina is dying of animescence, the disease of the Elder Continent. Any passion speeds the disease. She must, therefore, lie very still in an ice bath and think of things that do not interest her. Going sharp in the spleen protects her against the passion of anger, but other passions are still a danger.\r\n\r\nFor a long time she looked for a cure to the disease. Tradition ascribes healing features to certain poems, ointments, and postures of the body. But these only delay the gradual combustion.

"But if they know how, they refuse to say. Now... I merely keep back the disease as long as I can, and seek cures of the sentiment instead. If I keep very calm, my symptoms subside.

Another line and the ice in her tub steams. \r\n\r\nA quick-witted nurse leaps to prevent disaster. "Get out," she growls, having sequestered the letter in her apron. "Tell Lorenzo his love will be her death." Rosina is silent, but her eyes burn.

Another transcribes the letter onto separate pages - each sentence, to be administered as the Burning Lady's disposition allows her to receive them.\r\n\r\nRosina reads slowly. She looks in your direction: her expression is fierce, as though you were talking in church. You step away into the other room until she is ready for you to return. Already you have seen enough - the page in her hand curls, languorously, from the heat.

The Salon of Silver Salts is hung with small lights, and the inhabitants look ordinary. They are sipping arsenical teas and dining on poisonous toadstools.

"True, you won't break your bones. Now they'll break you. Tear right through your muscle and skin, and stick out! Ha! Unless you go the rest of the way and grow a sharp skin, but..." He shrugs.

I founded the Seven Against Nidah. I failed. I fled. I bargained. I hid here. I make statues, and try to remember." She presses one hand to her head, as if it could trap the thoughts within.

>>>	Description	Mariam leads you into the Hall of Sevens, where her statue has been smashed to pieces. A new statue completes the line of the assembled Seven: a dignified and well-observed - if slightly <i>too</i> honest - effigy of you.\r\n\r\n"The Seven need a new Schemer. It can't be me, can it? I'm stuck down here. Or what's left of me is." She taps, angrily, at her skull. "First thing's first," she fetches two brooms, and passes one to you. "Sweep." She begins to brush at the thick dust that covers the floor.\r\n\r\nYour initial application of the broom reveals a painting: a jagged curve of coastline. The next exposes a scattering of islands, somehow familiar: are they the Phosgene Bleaks? Meanwhile, Mariam's brush has uncovered a green and many-canalled land with the word 'HELL' written across it. The floor is a map; no - a game-board depicting the whole of the Neath. Thin black lines turn it into a grid, and finer lines divide the squares into a finer grid.\r\n\r\n"In the next room are statues of our enemies and complicating parties. The Gracious, the Replete, the Presbyter, the Admiralty, Mount Nomad, and so forth. I always found -" she breaks off to scrub at a resilient clot of bone-dust, "- that it was easier to plan from a bat's-eye perspective." [Plan your conquest of Nidah.]\r\n

"I forget things, now, unless I write them down, or put faces to them."\r\n\r\n"Here among the other lost histories, I am hidden from the Presbyterate's agents and oracles.

Then, in a number of years, we give the order - and the Presbyterate turns against itself."

>>>	Description	Movements begin in small ways. Whispers in the bazaar; slogans daubed in alleyways. In this case, the words that spread are sacred - an order of the first Presbyter, written long ago in Nidah. "No man shall live a thousand years."\r\n\r\nWhen the people of the Elder Continent learn that their Presbyters don't die when they live to a thousand, but instead retire to the College of Mortality to advise the next ruler, they are incensed. The movement spreads slowly, the Mithridate Office - the Prester's own misinformers - working hard to stamp it out. \r\n\r\nYou keep it alive with the liberal application of money. The pebble is rolling, now. In a few years, you will lead the avalanche to Nidah.

The crewman who delivered them reports carrying them to the white villa atop the hill, where countless statues waited with stony, avid eyes.\r\n\r\nIt will take years to construct the whole fleet, but when the first vessel slides gracefully into Batuk's hidden shoreside encampment, its oars sing a joyous hosannah.

>>>	Description	Isery explains their plan. "First, we must cross the Desert of Eyes, where eyes bloom in the sands. Their regard strips all pretence, reducing the traveller to a state of foetal self-loathing. Hence the sunlight: we will blind them.\r\n\r\n"Next is the Listening Desert, where earthquakes pursue the unwary. Thus, the primordial shrieks - I propose to deafen it. Perhaps you notice a theme?\r\n\r\n"Lastly, we would reach at the Desert of Delights. The touch of its sands is indescribably engrossing. Our best hope here is something equally as captivating, to divert us. The whole journey will undoubtedly be awful, but I believe it can be done." Isery taps a clawed finger-ring on one sharp cheek-bone. What they have described is only the beginning of it. Finding the route is one thing.

Bloodshed stains her gemstoned streets. This close, the light of the Mountain is savage. Lenses of sapphire protect your eyes as you march along the Avenue of Lament. At its end, beyond a statue of the first Presbyter, is the funereal facade of the College of Mortality. Grey. Grim. \r\n\r\nYour detachment has penetrated furthest into the city. Batuk is at your side, bearing the Seven's apple-and-ploughshare banner. "This is it," he bellows, over the sound of battle. "The last time, this is as far as we got." Your moment is at hand.\r\n

Your second-in-command curses and draws her pistol, pushing her way towards you. Fortunately, you identified her as one of Isery's agents several months ago. Your men, forewarned, fire first.\r\n\r\nYou give an order. Your gun emplacements begin methodically shelling the College of Mortality. Its mortuary-friezes vanish in clouds of dust. Holes are blasted in the walls, revealing glimpses of a facsimile-paradise: chambers of extravagant wealth; gardens of fruit-heavy trees; seraphically-beautiful servants, now shredded by shrapnel.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will repair it and make it your palace, when the once-Presbyters of the College surrender. Ah. There we are: a white flag. A rag of dusty bed sheet, but the most beautiful sight in the Neath. It means the city is yours. It means the Mountain is yours. It means eternal life is yours. And yours alone.

Ceilings aglow with stars, or azure with dazzling recreations of a summer's sky. Pools of cold crystal water. Servants of seraphic beauty.\r\n\r\nThe once-Presters fight back. Their vitality is impossible. Bullets do not kill them, nor swords. Your men stop fighting like soldiers and start fighting like butchers. Your victory is slow, but inevitable.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the College a vast door guards the way into the Mountain's heart. Your remaining soldiers drag it open, revealing a tunnel reaching into the Mountain's searing stone. Not even your sapphire goggles allow you to see within. A warm breeze spills out, carrying the scents of saffron, of lavender, of apples. \r\n\r\nBeyond lies the Garden, root of immortality. The rest of the Seven join you, and you enter as one. Your followers are close behind - part march, part procession, part festival. You lead them through the blazing light, whiter than a sun's heart. [This captain's career is complete.]

Your men, forewarned, fire first.\r\n\r\nThe troops loyal to you gather, and form a ring around the College of Mortality. You only need to hold out for a day. Then the Replete arrive, at the head of a glass-eyed army from Arbour. The remaining forces of the Seven are trapped, divided, and cut down.\r\n\r\nThe gate of the College opens. A once-Presbyter steps out. There is something familiar about his face - the high cheeks, the stern nose; so like Mariam's. He shakes your hand. "Seven and seventy kingdoms make up the Presbyterate," he tells you, unrolling a golden map. "Choose one."

You lean in and breathe on the ice, fogging it. Bourdain gives a minuscule smile. Then he raises a finger and begins to draw a message in the fog from the other side. \r\n\r\nHe writes backwards, which necessitates some deciphering. "I NEVER LEFT."\r\n\r\nIt is an awkward method of communication, but over the next few hours you manage to piece together his tale. Bourdain is relatively content with his current state. After the Seven's defeat, he attempted to hide in Frostfound. He failed at 'the Ruby Room', and this vestige was trapped in the ice. He has a number of agents in the Neath, though, and they are able to communicate with him via... you can't really follow that bit.

The black sun is closer, now, glaring into the chamber like a child through a dollhouse window.\r\n\r\nPain blooms behind your left temple. It migrates: across your cheek, down your neck, over your shoulder. You clutch at it, and feel a sliding, swelling pucker on your skin before it moves out of reach.\r\n\r\n"The Liberation of Night began long ago," the veiled creature pipes. "Tell whoever you choose, or do not. You are the message. Those who must know, will know." It bangs its measuring-rod on the floor. The sun screams in joy. Everything goes dark.\r\n\r\nYou find yourself back in your zubmarine, your crew desperately steering it away from the vast eye on the zee-bed. Your pain is easing, but not gone.

Your vision floods with inky gloom.\r\n\r\nWhen it recedes you are back in your zubmarine, your crew frantically steering it away from the vast eye that dominates the zee-bed. You spring to help them

As he passes your brew, bellows of pain engulf the room, and all Hideaway trembles for a moment as the beast below writhes - but the Visionary doesn't spill a drop of the coffee.

I'll point the what/where.</i>' He hands you a pair of tweezers, and unscrews the back of the panel, exposing a mess of wire.\r\n\r\nThe operation itself is simple, if slow, but the results are immediate. The lights outside flicker, before shining brighter. Arik flips a switch; the ground shakes, and you're thrown left. He flips another; you're thrown right. Arik beams as he helps you steady yourself, and pats you on the back. '<i>Sorry for that - all's well, now. You've done a great service. Eternal thanks.</i>'

>	Description	A moist group of Drownies bears down on you. Their leader, a Drownie Paleographer, looks at the Cargo with relish. "Excellent! This is worthy of display!" How did they hear of this so quickly? Do they have spies at the dock?\r\n\r\nHer smug smile disappears with the loud arrival of a gang of Chelonates, armed with heavy books. They push towards you, their expressions angry. "We would bury this insult!" one cries.

>>	Description	The truth should be revealed.
>>>	Description	The Chelonates swear inventively. One hurls her book to the ground. Sullenly, they retreat back into the skeletal chambers. \r\n\r\nThe Drownie Paleographer clasps your hand in thanks. "It's good to see them humbled. What does it matter if their wretched turtle was dead when they found it? Have they not prospered?" Her fellows carry the Cargo away. The Paleographer rewards you with several writhing bone-worms. "For preservation - they will be killed if they stay here. They tend to ruin the books." \r\n\r\n[This story can be continued in Scrimshander centre.]

Downcast, the Drownies depart through an arched tunnel.\r\n\r\nA Chelonate Chronologist thanks you. "The Drownies tell us that our histories are only stories. Well they are <i>our</i> stories." He presents you with a collection of dusty relics, then heads after his fellows. \r\n\r\n[This story can be continued in Scrimshander centre.]

>	Description	The walls here have crumbled, revealing an old vault. It is narrow, like a cloister of bone. The Muscular Monk hauls the Cargo inside. "I shall make my vigil here. Wall me up once I'm within."\r\n\r\nInside, you can see other casks, similar to the Cargo. A skeleton sprawls before each, or a mouldering corpse. How many times have the Chelonates buried this secret?\r\n\r\n

>>	Description	Wall him in. 
>>>	Description	You begin to wedge bones into the hole. You arrange long bones like bars to provide a central structure. Then you surround them with vertebrae, slotting them neatly together. Where a gap remains, you pout bonemeal into it.\r\n\r\nThe last you see of the Monk, he has laid a ragged blanket over the Cargo of Answers, and is sitting silently upon it, head bowed. The last bones grind into place. He is gone.\r\n

>	Description	The Fathomking examines the box. He runs a pruney finger over the engraved reliefs. He studies the inscriptions, about a starving hunter lost at zee, who washed up on the fresh corpse of a giant turtle, and founded a settlement.\r\n\r\nHis Complexity purses his lips. "They told us they were champions. The terms of our agreements were founded on that claim. I must punish them, I think." \r\n
>	Teaser	The Fathomking examines the box...
>>	Description	The Chelonates justify their bloodthirst with false history. A new song - of the Chelonate's shame - should be sung throughout the zee.
>>>	Description	The Fathomking nods. "Indeed. Sunken secrets have a habit of becoming buoyant again." He claps his hands. "Summon my lyricists! Bring me my harpsichord! The truth travels further and endures longer when it is set to music." He leans towards you. "I have never particularly liked the Chelonates. All that bone and bluster. Here, a reward."\r\n\r\n[Return to Scrimshander to continue the story.]

>>>	Description	The Fathomking furrows his wrinkled brow. He cuts you off with an upraised finger. "And what of the tribute they pay me? Should that be forgotten, too?" The tribute of lions, you point out, elevates the king that receives it. But the tribute of jackals demeans him.\r\n\r\n"Eloquently put." He bestows a thin-lipped smile upon you. "Very well. From this day on, we shall not speak or sing of the Chelonate. They are nothing. And you - you may leave, with this for your service." This last is meant for you.\r\n\r\n[Return to Scrimshander to continue the story.]
