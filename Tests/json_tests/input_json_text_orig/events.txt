Then we knew it had sighted us, for thick smoke rose as it roused its engines and gave chase. Its limbs bristled. Through the glass now I could see what lay at the meeting-point of its faces: thousands upon thousands of spider-eyes, champing spider-fangs, fused together like wax. A spider-council! but one of unprecedented size, and crammed strangely into a hybrid ship. It could only be the Tree of Ages: and the first day of our flight began..."

Moustachioed women and languorous men play chess, carve bones, eat cats and polish their terrifying brass weapons. These are Iron Republic privateers: pirates whose practices contravene the very laws of nature.
>	Name	A Privateer Encampment
>>>	Teaser	The privateers run, yell, and fall! - 
>>>	Description	The privateers run, yell, and fall! But now one seizes a weapon like a trombone inscribed with blasphemies. It conjures an appalling vibration which converts your zailors to screaming jellies. Another crouches behind a rock: she employs a kind of mortar which rains down lethal pine-cones. They smell delightful, but their perfume causes pine-needles to erupt in green masses from your ears, mouths and necks. Your crew is lost to bewildered terror: you flee as the triumphant privateers celebrate amid flares of red light.
>>>	Name	An unfair fight
>>>	Teaser	Your first volley does satisfyingly grievous damage, but a half-dozen privateers snatch up weapons...
>>>	Description	Your first volley does satisfyingly grievous damage, but a half-dozen privateers snatch up weapons. One is a sort of Gatling gun. One appears to fire bubbles composed of rainbow meat. A third makes it rain in your heart. The fourth weapon explodes in a shower of fat purple sparks that chirp like canaries and chew their way through everything in the encampment - privateers, tents, loot. The battle is over before it's begun, but by the time it's safe to approach, the sparks have devoured many of the privateers' treasures...

>>>	Description	The Republicans conspire gleefully in a tangled and multifarous pidgin - French, English, Polythremic, the languages of Hell. You can make out words here and there - "liver" - "thunder" - "expunge" - "consume" - but it's hard to resolve them into sense. The longer you listen, the less sense it makes, until you begin to fear what effect their infernal whispering is having. When your bo'sun turns to whisper to you, and you hear only the bleating of a goat, you realise it's time to retreat...
>>>	Name	A hive of murderous bees

But they speak, too, almost coherently, of privateer lairs in the Western Wall, of passwords in use, of Brass Embassy protocols and of tuning-techniques for drawing lost souls close...\r\n\r\nA buzzing rises in your brain as you listen, until your eyes become unfocused and your tongue feels thick and heavy. You creep away before anything worse can happen. But this is an odd and useful miscellany of facts.

>>>	Description	The Cook has converted pots into kettle-drums. The Quartermaster has improvised pan-pipes. That squint-eyed fellow from Shepherd's Wash has brought out an actual fiddle. They set up on a dark beach lit by torches on poles, and do eight folk-songs, a mischievous music-hall number called The Empress Likes Them Quiet, and an odd restless little tune like a caged cat. "My own composition," the Washman confides.\r\n\r\nHonestly, they're not very good. They are unrehearsed and uneven, and the presence of something serpentine in the surf puts them off. But those homely sounds here on the deep's doorstep - something about it lifts the heart.

The click of a sliding stone where there should be silence - a motion in the shadows, as if they were thick-stirred like ink - a lull in the cries of the zee-bats. Something is watching you, drawing closer hour by hour. You and your crew draw back to back, watching the darkness.

>>>	Description	One of your crew strays too far from the group. You never know why - you don't know it's happened until you hear him cry out. As your crew rushes to assist, there's another cry from behind you. Another zailor vanishes into the darkness! You glimpse a writhing coil of limbs and the glitter of eyes, and the beast is gone. The beasts. There must be at least two of them. Who knows how many more?\r\n\r\nYou retreat with haste to the ship, eyes wide, though you see nothing more of the predators. Perhaps their hunger is satisfied.
>>>	Name	A bad end
>>>	Teaser	Deep silence...
>>>	Description	Deep silence. A faint scrape, like boot-leather on stone. The woman on your left levels her rifle and fires - and your crew joins her. The fusillade almost drowns out the hoarse screeching of the creature in the shadows.\r\n\r\nWhen you drag into the light, its oily flesh is already beginning to dissolve (perhaps the light is hastening it?) Whatever it was, it had many-jointed leathery limbs, eyes like a bunch of grapes, a folding assembly of mandibles. It stinks of vinegar and mould. You fling a tarpaulin over it and bundle it into the darkest part of the hold. Perhaps someone will want it.

>>>	Description	You stalk it through the darkness, directing your crew to set up blinds and baffles and spikes and snares. It doesn't go well. One of your zailors steps into her own pit trap, and another backs off the cliff trying to do something elaborate with a rope. You see nothing more of the beast, but your wretched crew is proving to be more of a danger anyway. Back to the ship.

>>>	Description	You employ ruses, stratagems and a cruel choice of bait, harrying the thing through the archipelagic midnight until it collapses into your trap with a hoarse screech! You bind it with chains and blankets and force it into a triple-locked cage. It snaps its folding assembly of jaws. Its many-jointed limbs creak as it strains against its bonds. Its eyes brim with primal rage. Excellent! It'll be worth an Echo or ten.

>	Description	At the heart of a salty little bog, you come upon a pulsing mound of blemmigans! They are a rich dark purple, like viscera, perhaps, or blackberries. They chitter as they swarm: the sound is like pebbles on a beach. Be careful. A single blemmigan is a nuisance. A hundred are a calamity.
>	Name	A Blemmigan Colony
>>>	Teaser	You hush your men and watch it go...
>>>	Description	You hush your men and watch it go. It swoops down on the mound, to the alarm of a little circle of blemmigans who stand at the top like citizens attending a public meeting. Their tentacles whip menacingly as they advance - but the cockatoo says something to give them pause. You strain your ears to hear. Fragments of screeched poetry from your pet vie with the shrill fluting of the blemmigans... are they reciting poetry too? Is this a competition? A greeting?\r\n\r\nAbruptly, your Cockatoo rises, and returns to sit on your shoulder. It preens delightedly and delivers four lines of perfect decasyllabic quatrain on 'those thousand shapes of unforgiven Time'. You have no idea what the hell it's talking about, but the delivery is terribly impressive.
>>	Name	Your Elegiac Cockatoo takes an interest

>>>	Teaser	Fire into the purple mass! - 
>>>	Description	Fire into the purple mass! Dozens of blemmigans fall, but hundreds remain. They seethe across the bog, leaping across black gaps of standing water, maws agape! Your crew's volleys falter, and the blemmigans fall on them. You call for a retreat, and your zailors fall back, plucking fang-mawed blemmigans from arms and legs. Several go down under the mass. You'll mourn them later.

>>>	Description	Armed zailors settle behind a rise in the ground at the bog's edge. On your signal, they open fire into the purple mass! Dozens of blemmigans fall, but hundreds remain. They seethe across the bog, leaping across black gaps of standing water, maws agape! But you direct your crew's fire with calm and precision, and only a few reach the line. Your crew methodically smash them with rifle-stocks and advance with caution towards the bog. The blemmigans which remained to defend the mound are no match for your weaponry: you take the mound without a single fatality and they die, chittering curses.\r\n\r\nOf course, now you're possessed of a mound of mud. You find nothing of value, although the blemmigans apparently collected little clay tablets marked with indecipherable chicken-scratchings. Your quartermaster, however, points out that the blemmigan bodies can be rendered into purple dye, which will fetch a good price almost anywhere...

>>>	Name	Mildly diverting
>>>	Teaser	They do resemble the fruiting bodies of fungus...
>>>	Description	They do resemble the fruiting bodies of fungus. The mound itself looks fungal. Are they the same organism? And they communicate and cooperate. You watch as they drag a marsh-rat up the side of the mound, bickering over the disposition of its flesh. And you watch as a half-dozen stand on the top of the mound, listening respectfully to the chittering of a seventh. It's improbably reminiscent of a poetry recital. You take notes.

A human shin-bone has been half-carved into a flute. "A reckoning!" the cannibal cackles as he's dragged off to the brig. "A reckoning is not to be postponed!"\r\n\r\nYou hold a hasty ship-court and sentence him to the only conceivable penalty: binding and drowning. He's still laughing as the sea pours into his mouth.

The decrepit and nearly-dead who leave London become tomb-colonists, and settle here in bandaged peace.\r\n\r\nBut they don't give up their ties to home, or their politics.

They look a little like the glyphs that decorate the Echo Bazaar in London, though...\r\n\r\n At the heart of the platform is a long-filled well-shaft, too. You poke about briefly, but something in the place makes you uneasy. A frost-moth - the size of a farmer's hand - flutters down to perch on the well's edge. Another. A third. You retreat...

The coffee is dusty, and the pastries a little stale, but the gaggle of decaying violin-players are skilled and surprisingly sprightly.

>>>	Description	Dead fir-trees have carpeted a little park with old brown needles. A little group of tomb-colonists stands around another lying on a bench. Unexpectedly, you find yourself reminded of physicians and midwifes at a birthing-couch. The colonist on the bench - he's old, withered to sticks - groans horribly, though the fir-needles deaden the sound. Something moves in his chest, like a sea-creature surfacing, or a butterfly breaching a cocoon. \r\n\r\nThe other colonists spot you, and close ranks around him. "Stay back, silkskin," one hisses. "This is <i>his</i> breaking-out. Your time will come..." There is a kind of rapture in her voice.

You beat them off with your walking-stick - they are determined, and the largest are the size of zee-bats, but they are fragile. At last they retreat, leaving three of their number melting into water on the pavement. Their wings are marked with patterns that resemble letters.

Peering through the half-rotten timber, you see them prise open the coffins laid within, and rob the pretend-dead of their jewels and silks.\r\n\r\nThat is, at least, until they gather around a black coffin, festooned with ribbons. "Cor! Look at that little treasure there on 'er finger," says one. "Come here, you - ah!" A truncheon swings out of the coffin, cracking his crown. The other two scatter, as a woman leaps out of the black coffin, like a sleeper from a nightmare, and chases them down. This must be the Constable.

"The Snuffer you caught was extremely surprised by its interrogation: it was under the impression that it was working for <i>us</i>. One of our London diplomats has decided that the expedience of using Snuffers outweighs the prohibition on associating with them. He is incorrect."\r\n\r\nHe introduces his associate, a Hands-On Diplomat. "I'd like you to see her safely to the Presbyterate embassy in London.

At first the local fishermen welcomed an easy harvest, but in time they came to dislike the disruption and the permanent rotting smell.

But on the way back to the ship, one of your crew topples over with a groan. She's smiling blissfully. "Go on, cap'n," she says. "I've missed the zun." Her eyes close.

We have taken what we need from him, long ago, and laid him to rest. " [You have his bones: his poor bones. Take them to London to complete the game.

"YOU MUST STRIKE THEM IN ONLY THE CORRECT PLACE." Another dissolves, with a sound like a sigh. "THUS."\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's just that you've inhaled too much dust, but as you watch the Bone Man, the scene becomes distant. You are watching it from a great height. The roof?\r\n\r\nThe maul swings: the stones shatter. This is the nature of strength. This is good.\r\n\r\n"THIS IS THE WORK OF STORM," intones the Bone Man. You blink.

>	Description	A naval base, with the Royal Navy's emblems, curiously amended. Efficient, bright-eyed women and men work briskly, everywhere you look. They are singing: hymns with unfamiliar words. Hard-faced Royal Marines watch you carefully, barring entry to the Geode's heart.\r\n\r\nA plaque by the docks has been defaced with orange paint, but you can still make out the original inscription: 'STATION V (ADJUNCT)'.

(A monograph on perception.) And here - "\r\n\r\nShe leans forward and kisses you, once on each eyelid. As she draws back, the world is changed. You always knew the Neath was a place where the laws of the sunlit world did not apply: but now, somehow, you can <i>see</i> it. Is this chaos? Or freedom?\r\n\r\nThe Quartermaster directs her labourers to pack up the stone. The zee is quiet. The Geode glows like a lamp.

>>>	Description	The Commodore shakes your hand warmly. He's a handsome, open-faced fellow in an immaculate Navy uniform. His office is equally handsome. It overlooks the glittering interior crystal cliff - it must be as well lit as any study in the Neath. He deflects questions about the purpose of this installation - "classified, you know" - but smilingly offers you tea, biscuits and mineralogical anecdotes.\r\n\r\nThe biscuits are good, but the anecdotes rather blend one into the next. You find yourself nodding, and then jerk suddenly awake. The Commodore is smiling. Your cup is empty. You feel well: very well. A little euphoric, even. "Come back soon," he says softly.

>>>	Description	The Sequencers who serve the Machine take charge of your supplies. Your crew go gaping and bewildered into the fractured light of the Geode. Officers listen intently to your intelligence. And you whisper the Dread Surmise into the translucently perfect ear of the Commodore himself. (He smells like spice and sunlight.)\r\n\r\nThree days and three nights later, a procession of marines carries a cedar casket to your ship, decorated with gold leaf. You open it, very cautiously. The skull which once adorned the Eater of Names now lies within, its forehead marked with a glyph of furious power. The shape of it chatters your teeth and vibrates your vision. This will drink the danger of the sunlight. Who knows what else it might do? But it will suffice. It will permit you to colonise Aestival.
>>>	Name	Dawn's Law
>>	Name	Ask the Commodore for a defence against sunlight for Aestival
>>	Description	He smiles warmly. "Of course," he says. "But we'll need our usual consideration to do the work. And it won't be easy. We'll need a gant-source from near the Chelonate; and a particular insight. A very, very particular insight." [The gant-source can be obtained from the Eater of Names, near the Chelonate. A Dread Surmise can be assembled by the Alarming Scholar from seven Searing Enigmas.]

>>>	Description	The Apprentice's voice catches in his throat when he tries to speak. Finally, he takes a deep breath, and manages to whisper: "He'll make thousands more. Just like the first one." \r\n\r\nHe turns to you; beads of sweat have gathered at his temples. "I wanted to defy the laws of nature. But not like that. And now the zee will burn." The Dogged Apprentice dabs his forehead with a handkerchief, then brushes past you to join the bright-eyed people of the Grand Geode.

>>>	Description	"We're keeping the steps for the Game of Truths," a Helpful Riddlefisher explains, as she fills your cup for the third time. "Every year, the people of Irem and Whither meet here, for - " she pauses. "Contests," she finished vaguely. "The difference between a question and a riddle. One day, someone will prove themselves enough to enter the castle."\r\n\r\nYou spend a pleasant few hours, while the tea is supplemented with Iremi liqueurs, pale Whithern beer, and something the Riddlefisher describes blandly as 'snake cake'. They offer you fuel and supplies before you leave. "We keep enough to spare," the Riddlefisher grins. "From time to time a captain gets lost and comes up here, and we always feel bad for them."
>>>	Name	A surprisingly warm welcome

>>	Description	Some of them wear the robes of Iremi Riddlefishers; some look like Whithern folk, but even more ragged. But they do seem a little more practical than either of those peoples.

>>>>	MoveMessage	You have moved to a new area
>>>>	Name	The Corridors of Frostfound
>>>	Description	"You probably shouldn't do that," one of the squatters advises. Ignore her. Face the wall. Examine your cloudy reflection. Close your eyes. Step forward. Shiver. Frostfound radiates both cold, and a subtler chill of the heart.\r\n\r\nDid you move at all? Or is it your reflection that moved? You are inside Frostfound. 
>>>	Name	Face the wall
>>	Name	Enter Frostfound
>>	Description	A long flight of stairs rises glistening to a sheer tower. There is no door. Your reflection hangs in the cloudy ice. [You cannot enter Frostfound if your Terror is greater than 20; and you should not enter Frostfound without a good reason.]
>>>	Teaser	Only a few minutes later, you glance back, and the Navigator is gone...
>>>	Description	Only a few minutes later, you glance back, and the Navigator is gone. You climb the steps to examine the spot where you saw him last. His coat lies in the snow. His footprints end at the tower wall.\r\n\r\nYou poke through his coat and find a brass telescope from the Khanate, a much-annotated chart, tobacco, an alarming quantity of lice. But the Navigator is gone. You never see him again.
>>>	Name	Where is he?
>>	Name	Allow the Sly Navigator to examine the tower
>>	Description	He climbs the steps, panting eagerly. "This is the zee, you see?" he calls back. "The zee risen to become land. Ice is the zoul of the zee. In ice, we find the zee at her most exemplary -" And he's off again. You leave him to examine the tower, staring up at the battlements, his breath dragon-huffing.

I'm an engineer. Finest you'll ever hire. Treat engines like my own children. Not that I have children. Too busy. Usually busy." [The Tireless Mechanic increases Veils and Fuel Efficiency.]
>>>	Teaser	"We get enthusiasts here, from time to time...
>>>	Description	"We get enthusiasts here, from time to time. Yes, you might be able to enter the castle before the appointed time. You might even find something of value there. But you'd be despoiling sacred ground, my friend. It will take your stories from you. It will take your essence, your self. And if you survive that, you'll likely anger the gods of the zee. Yes, they're real. As real as the corridors of Frostfound are. Stay away, my friend, stay away."
>>>	Name	"If you can enter... you should not."
>>	Name	Ask the squatters about the Castle

>>>	Teaser	Its moist tendrils freeze to the icy ground as soon as it's off the gang-plank...
>>>	Description	Its moist tendrils freeze to the icy ground as soon as it's off the gang-plank. It squeals, speeding back into the ship to huddle in the engine-room. It's made its opinions on Frostfound very clear.
>>>	Name	Not that adaptable
>>	Name	Put a blemmigan ashore
>>	Description	Snow, ice, a few squatters. A harsh environment for vegetation. But blemmigans are adaptable.
>>>	Teaser	He didn't exaggerate...
>>>	Description	He didn't exaggerate. The ice is slick as an oiled mirror. You need pitons and spiked boots to navigate the slopes, and a misplaced foot will send great chunks of it thundering into the thirsty sea. The air bites like a bound shark. Your face is numb, your fingers stiff, your throat raw. The climb takes you around a sheer white cliff, the waters below swimming with shards of razored ice.\r\n\r\nAt last, a frozen ledge. A vertical sheet of ice rises before you, reflective as a conjurer's glass. Engraved upon it, twenty feet high, is the Navigator's sigil. "Impressive, isn't it?" the researcher says, dropping his pack. "It's one of the old accords between Whither and Irem. It means <i>Almost Never Remembered</i>."\r\n\r\nYour Navigator approaches it warily. The sigil on his temple sparks with blue fire. He reaches out, his fingers touching those of his reflection in the ice - and his reflection lunges forward, whispering something in his ear. The Navigator crumples into the snow. "Oh." The Plucky Researcher says. "Damn. We're going to have a devil of a time getting him back to the ship." You do. But you manage it.\r\n\r\nBack in your cosy cabin you imbibe mulled rum. Will you ever be warm again? [Speak to your Sigil-Ridden Navigator to learn what happened.]
>>>	Name	Almost Never Remembered
>>	Name	Show the squatters your Navigator's sigil
>>	Description	A Plucky Researcher recognises it. "I know it well! I can show you, but the way isn't easy. I'll not take anyone frail. You'll need ropes, crampons, skins, tents. And I'll want paying, of course - my bursary is wearing rather thin."
>>>	Teaser	Not all are Iremi or Whithern...

>>>	Teaser	The Riddlefisher shares a series of linked riddles with you...
>>>	Description	The Riddlefisher shares a series of linked riddles with you. You identify the linking factor: it's a prediction about who will win the Contest between questions and riddles, next year. Perhaps the Admiralty will find it useful. It's the closest thing to information about the balance of power, this far north.
>>>	Name	"When will the towers topple?"

>>>	Teaser	"Who questions the questioner?
>>>	Description	"Who questions the questioner?" "What is the name of your employer?" "Why do you think I would know?" Is she being obtuse? Are these code-phrases you don't recognise? Has the Khanate employed a counter-agent to bewilder you? Will these questions ever end? You are forced to give up. The mission is a failure.
>>>	Name	"Why would such a ship come here?"
>>>	Teaser	The Whithern is even more elliptical than most of her kind...
>>>	Description	The Whithern is even more elliptical than most of her kind. You realise quickly that she's trying to warn you off. There must be an enemy agent here. Take that information back to London. Sometimes the absence of an answer is an answer in itself.
>>>	Name	"Why would such a ship come here?"
>>	Name	Speak to a Whithern contact instead
>>	Description	Interestingly, a Whithern dock-squatter is also wearing a red-and-blue scarf. What are the odds she'll give you an answer at all?

>>>	Description	The Cladery Heir presents herself on deck. She carries a bag full of sharp blades and serrated blades, short strong blades, toothed blades like saws, long-handled shears, knives whose edges are invisible. She is ready to cut with glass, or with diamond, or with fire, as required.

>	Teaser	The Mourn is a stalagmite vast as a crag, and its foot has no safe harbours...
>	Description	The Mourn is a stalagmite vast as a crag, and its foot has no safe harbours. The corsair's citadel nestles halfway up. An intricate system of winches takes the strain... and your ship rises slowly from the zee. Her hull creaks in protest. Grizzled zailors groan and cling to stanchions.\r\n\r\nHigher, higher. Now the Unterzee shimmers like glass below. Children clambering in crevices cheer and wave alarmingly. The winch-motor slows, and you hang in a cradle next to a red-bowed pirate cutter.

>>>	Description	Some say she's a Clay Man who freed herself with the power of verse. (Possible.) Others insist she's the personal muse of the King with the Hundred Hearts. (Unlikely.) One claims she zails on a living ship made of the still screaming skulls of her victims. (More sober voices mutter that no, it's just an Alcaeus-class vessel.)\r\n\r\nWhatever the truths, few have fought her and survived to tell the tale.

Who wants to be a proper d__n hero? \r\n\r\nThe zailors' songs die. They all watch, enthralled as you speak of a place fit for the fiercest. Where gigantic mouths bite through hulls and devour ships from inside out. Where leviathans crack ships like eggs, and eat. \r\n\r\nYou zailed by such a d__ned ship, but were too afraid to fight the terror below - but these captains - these heroes...

It seems heavy, although he claimed it held only documents and writing equipment for an interview with a pirate king.\r\n\r\nThe day passes relatively peacefully. There are brawls, but in good fun - the blood washed away with celebratory beer. By night, the boisterous cheer has given way to whispers about an uncommonly brutal murder, executed within an experimental shipyard.

Sank to the bottom and swam back up - there's nothin' he can do to me." He leans close. His breath smells of brine. \r\n\r\n"But let me share what I learned on the way: what's lost is lost. The Fathomking won't heal the Cheery Man's leg. Even if he would, his Cheeriness wouldn't want to pay that price. Tell him to stop dreamin'." [Return to London to deliver the bad news.]
>>>	Name	Unrepentant

>>>	Teaser	Place it in water if it needs reviving...
>>>	Description	Place it in water if it needs reviving. Crush it and bite it when the need arises. It is proof against seeing things that aren't there, "which is the only trick they know in Dahut." A sniff and a jealous song go with this observation.
>>>	Name	Sprig and fins
>>	Name	Trade for a White Mollyflower

>	Description	Rumpled convolutions of coral fill the water, glimmering with silvery light. The harder you look, the more you see shapes amid the chaos, almost as if they were sculpted. This one could be a crenellated castle: that one, a horse's head.\r\n\r\n A neat little port huddles into the side of a coral island - prosaic Imperial docks and houses tucked away in a baroque organic chaos. In that curious silvery light, among the frozen chaos of coral, the scene has the unreal air of a pencil sketch, crumpled and discarded.

>>>	Description	Here is a Rubbery Man: one of the squid-faced bipedal things that infest the sadder hovels of Fallen London. It looks ill, or infected. The pearly glow of the coral throbs from a seam along its shoulder, its arm - pulses in its face-fronds. "Otharooth," it pipes, cheerfully. It hands you a page of notes smeared with tangerine goo. Can Rubbery Men write? The hand is elegant and disciplined - times and dates precisely recorded.

>>>	Description	The older inhabitants of Port Cecil carry coral encrustations like a disease: splotched with silvery light. They like to go up into the limestone heights behind the harbour, to lay their heads against the pillars and towers, stare at the roof of the Neath, dream, open-eyed. Sometimes, they speak of things far away: the Khanate's work, the smuggler wars, the Fathomking's secrets. Perhaps it's not all invented...

The Gallivant pulls the package's string. "A thousand years is more than enough. Don't you think?" He tosses it into the room, before slamming the door.

>>>	Description	It's against local law and custom to break coral from the reef, and you've seen the scars of those who tried - the acid-burns, the blind silver eyes. So you're looking for loose fragments. Today the zee is calm, and you find a good few candidates. They lie shining softly like droplets of moon.\r\n\r\nBut after a little while, you become concerned that they're eyes: that each is watching you. When you close your fist around one, it examines your blood with amused delight. When you put them together in your pocket, they clatter and gossip together. Of course, you think. They broke from the Shining Mind: they have its vitality, but not its weariness or experience. You will have to lock them in a separate boxes, lest they peep at you when you're bathing, and see who you are. The thought of their sight on your skin fills you with horror. What if your skin turned clear? What if they saw your bones?\r\n\r\nYou come back to yourself when you see one of your zailors fall on his back and start kicking delightedly in the air like a beetle. "Gravity!" he cries. "I have fallen!" You hasten back to the ship with your haul of coral, before it can do any further damage.

>>>	Description	Where the zee washes across the coral's edge, it glows a rich purple. Each time it washes across your boots, you expect it to leave stains. You edge along the slippery coral, picking up lumps of brighter-glowing stuff here and there: and though the zee doesn't stain, eventually it begins to whisper to you: phrases so clear that you catch yourself looking over your shoulder in case your crew have spoke. They have not. They're looking around, just as you are.\r\n\r\n<i>Between stars,</i> the zee says. <i>Descend the chain.</i> When it runs out across the coral, it sounds almost like a soft chuckle. <i>I rest here,</i> it tells you. <i>I forget.</i>

>>>	Description	Odd thoughts bubble up each time you touch a chess-piece. This one longs for home. That one has a secret desire for revenge against the slayer of its rank-mate. This will be a queen one day. Those would do better as metal: you taste the metal. You ignore these thoughts, and move methodically to a victory over your opponent. He blinks. "Checkmate?" he asks helplessly. [Win enough games, and something else will occur.]
>>>	Name	A disciplined success
>>>	Teaser	You don't know how long you've been playing...
>>>	Description	You don't know how long you've been playing. You won a match, another. The rough coral tips of the chess-pieces are smeared with blood: yours, your opponent's. But you have begun to realise that your moves recapitulate the movements of the powers of the Neath: the Flukes and their shapelings. The Bazaar that lurks in London. Mt Nomad, that prowls the sea. Salt, Stone, Storm. With every move you take, the shape of it becomes clearer in your mind, sharper.\r\n\r\n"Checkmate," you say. One more game? Your first officer is tugging at your arm. Ignore them. You have chess to play. [Win enough games, and something else will occur.]

>>>	Description	You don't often look at chess-pieces: not <i>really</i> look. The Bishops, with their hooks. The Night, with its mane and teeth. The Kin and the Cream, white mingled with red. The Roots that pin the corner of the board down, to keep you safe from your opponent. You lift a Paw to toy with it: touch its velvety pads.\r\n\r\n"Checkmate," your opponent says. She grins. "Look too closely, did we? You need to be careful with scintillack chess-sets."\r\n\r\nHer face is blank and white as the dome of a chess-pawn. Get out. Get back to the ship, until the waking-dream of the coral clears.
>>>	Name	A distraction
>>	Description	Chess is popular in the Principles. The port is full of exiles, drunks and washed-up zee-traders. They all play, often obsessively.\r\n\r\nBe careful. The chess-pieces are carved from scintillack. Here in the Principles, that can be very dangerous.

"Casualties are unfortunate," he says, pulling the package's string; "But acceptable." He tosses the package into the room and slams the door shut. An explosion blasts the door from its hinges; it falls between you both. You peek into the room. The bodies are scattered like chess pieces from an upturned board.

>>>	Description	Blunt Thomas takes you around the office: a small collection room where those retrieving letters may state their business. A much larger set of back offices where newly arrived letters and parcels are collected and sorted. A dank, briny smell that never goes away, presumably because so many of the parcels spent time in the water before they arrived here.\r\n\r\nIn the back room is a machine manned (ratted?) by a Postal Rat, a Rattus Faber in a pinstriped hat. It shovels sludge-damp letters into the machine's hopper and they come out dried, cleaned, pressed, and sorted into slots by size and quality of paper.

The fashion of wearing a postbag with nothing inside. (Wearing it open; wearing it upside down, torn apart, or as a hat; wearing it any way that will show it doesn't have letters in it.) \r\n\r\nThen there are the sitting rooms papered in cancelled stamps. The bergamot-pomegranate curd on toast. The commerce in rat-corpses. The hatred of cats. The absolute custom against ever issuing a paper invitation for any event no matter how formal. \r\n\r\nIt's the familiarity, the not-quite-London-ness of the place that makes it all so... odd.

>>>	Description	There's the statue in the middle of the island. That's hard to miss. There's the way everyone wears a uniform, and the way they call each other by their ranks in the postal service. There's the way the port authorities refer to Regulations. There's the jargon, the curious habit of referring to any used-up thing as 'cancelled', as though the whole world were made of stamps. \r\n\r\nYou write about vestigial bureaucracy and about trappings of order retained far from home.

The thoughtless machine-work of the Postal Rat, who is so eager to know nothing about the true nature of the Dead Letter Office. You show the postmen as you know they secretly understand themselves: unworthy of their uniforms, outcast from the rest of the Postal Service, a disgrace to their Regulations.

Their dead must be appropriately disposed of, using the traditional manner. If this were ten years ago, perhaps the boy could have kept it. But since the lorn-flukes were taught ambition, they are best not antagonised. I will deliver this corpse to my liege. I have no doubt his chef will prepare it most respectfully."

"The heart is destiny's engine," the bo'sun mumbles. He looks embarrassed. "We shall all return," you find yourself reply. You light the pyre and stand back.\r\n\r\nThe flames warm you, warm your crew. The light plays on your faces and your outstretched hands. The darkness shrinks back.

East - it went East when it was done. There are drums beneath my feet. Look where I rise. Look when I am gone! Oh, those colours, those colours. My heart - my heart - "\r\n\r\nShe collapses. With a jubilant buzz, a cloud of red wasps bursts from her, circle once, and rise, disappear among the shadows of the column tops. High above, you hear an answering buzz.\r\n\r\nWhere she indicated roses, you find a cache of fuel buried beneath the bones of sacrifices. Where she spoke of drums, you find Khanate religious treasures beneath a stone - world-stones, ivory cups, a hand-drum of shell. \r\n\r\nThe zailors carry her corpse back to the ship. You spare a single glance for the ruined rags of her face. It's enough to see that she died smiling.

>>>	Description	Now the Mechanic wraps ivory segments with wire and scalds them with acid. He stains them with blood. ("I'll need some of yours, too," he says apologetically. "You're the captain.") He studs the bones with sapphires. He has the sailors bring up his last two custom-made components: an assemblage of copper tubes (in which he places the Element of Dawn) and a steel capsule the size of a barrel (which he has the zailors lock into the Impeller's black bone core).\r\n\r\n"Almost ready," he affirms."It just needs a spark, and a heart." He looks to the Unsettling Sage.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," the Sage says, a little sadly. "The heart is destiny's engine." He climbs into the capsule at the Impeller's heart, and locks the framework into place behind him. The Mechanic strikes the tubes which contain the Element, and it spits forth a sizzle of rosy light. The ivory blazes instantly with energy! The capsule, instantly incandescent with heat, seals shut forever. With a ticking sound, it slowly begins to cool.\r\n\r\nThe Impeller stands radiant and whole before you: a jigsaw of heatlessly blazing ivory, with a martyr at its core. "What a relief!" the Mechanic says. "I wasn't entirely sure that would work." He claps you on the shoulder. "My work is done. Thank you. Thank you!"
>>>	Name	Destiny's Engine
>>	Name	Construct the Fulgent Impeller
>>	Description	Under directions from the Mechanic, your crew piece the slabs of black ivory together, as the ancients were said to assemble stone walls without mortar. Sometimes they must saw a piece in half, or abrade its sides to make it fit, but the work proceeds with surprising speed. The Impeller begins to take shape - a squat, heavy-shouldered shape, like a scarecrow built to resemble an engine.\r\n\r\n"I don't think this is engineering any more," the Mechanic confides. "Possibly it's witchcraft. But I don't really mind." He rubs his hands.

You open him up and remove the parts he doesn't need anymore. He laughs in exultation as each one goes wetly into the stone basin. \r\n\r\nYou carve six more copies of the sigil inside him, then close him up. He sits, smiles, stands, speaks. "Thank you, [q:Addressed As]. I am at home." The thing that follows you back to your ship is not the Navigator. But it has his skills, and his face (though the right half is blotted by the sprawling sigil). The crew edge away.

Only the binoculars remain as they were, untouched and untransmuted.\r\n\r\nYou pick them up and look to the East. Past the Deconstruction, where the known zee ends and the legends begin.

We had help: a London captain." He pauses, listening. You hear nothing, but the Gallivant smiles. "Oh, that is very just. Is there anything -? Yes. Yes. I will anticipate them. I'll -"\r\n\r\nThe Gallivant blinks, and laughs. He grins at you, his tongue cleaning the red from his teeth. "My master is a man guided by his principles: liberty, equality, eternity.

Phosphorescent cliff-clingers gawp as the zee sinks. Monster-bones rise from the murk. The ship tilts violently sideways, with a sound like a reef's jaw closing. The zee, the zee! It rises, black-fisted, and falls on you with all its weight.\r\n\r\nYou cling desperately to the helm. The waters drain away. Zailors lie coughing, or flopping like fish. Zeeweed drapes the railings. Around the ship, the lights of Wolfstack docks.

It seems to you that you are sitting on a hillside, above a wide blue lake, listening to a story of a murder. An axe. A net. Blood on scented water.\r\n\r\n"Another chop?" Cynthia asks.

>>>	Description	Phoebe has a story to tell: of two lovers parted by water, of a raven that carried messages, of a fragment of the moon. She beats time on the table as she speaks, as if to a song only she can hear. The effect is hypnotic.\r\n\r\nYour attention drifts, out through the skylight of the dining room, to the false-stars glittering in the roof of the cavern. You drift like a puffball-spore. The Unterzee shimmers below. Islands lie like mineral specimens on black velvet. Ships bob like wood-chips between the islands. Vast spined things pulse in the depths. There is a scent like the scent before a storm...\r\n\r\n"The storm came," says Phoebe quietly. "Everything changed." Somewhere in there, you finished the last course.

"We don't go in."\r\n\r\nThe signs on the stones have a Khaganian look. In the deepest sub-cellar, your candles illuminate a litter of tumbled stones - the remnants of a temple. The pool at the cellar's centre is almost dry. The remaining water there seethes oddly in the candle-light, as if it were near boiling, but it's quite cool to the touch.\r\n\r\n"The Writhing River flows near here," the Mechanic remarks. "One of the tributaries of dream. (I hope it doesn't touch the well those poor girls drink from.) My enemies find me when I sleep - but this water will attract my enemies to this poor fellow."\r\n\r\nHe bends to dip his hand in the water and sketches a sign on the Clay Man's forehead. The Man watches him stolidly. The Mechanic hands him the Mirrorcatch Box. "Hold this," he says. "Keep it open. Don't let go, no matter what happens." The Clay Man's huge hands enfold the box.\r\n\r\n"There," the Mechanic says, turning to you. "A serpent-trap. Now, I can sleep. I can finally sleep." He smiles. "And then I think I may be able to offer you something rather interesting." [Speak to the Mechanic on board ship to advance the story further.]

He glowers up at you. "This is not where the fluke belongs," the Drownie cries in a plummy voice. "It's to be taken else where. It already has a delivery label - that means I have to deliver it."\r\n\r\nThe Student sneers. "Sod your label! [q:Addressed As], help me haul the beast to Station III.

A dark-haired, pale-skinned young woman bends earnestly over a piano keyboard. Another, fair-haired but unmistakably her sister, sprawls on the sofa with a book. A third sits by the fireplace, staring sorrowfully into the embers.\r\n\r\nA log pops, and the woman by the fire gives a violent start. You cannot restrain a start of your own, and her eyes meet yours through the glass. She claps her hand to her mouth in shock. There is nothing to do but step apologetically into the room.\r\n\r\n "A visitor!" the pianist - the youngest - cries. The next youngest chuckles. The eldest, who you frightened, sighs. "Excuse us," she says. "Visitors are rare. You are very welcome. I am Cynthia: the noisy one is Phoebe, the cheerful one is Lucy. You are in good time for lunch. Will you join us?"

>>>	Description	You don't know the cliff paths like the locals do, and you have to climb more than walk. Your skin is sheened with sweat by the time you reach the top. They've started without you. How rude.\r\n\r\nAn elderly fellow wears a feathered head-dress and not much else: he seems to be leading the ceremony. One assistant holds an ear of corn (where did he find that down here?), another a stone jug, another a clay tablet. The elderly priest addresses them all to his congregation.\r\n\r\nYou catch snatches of it: "The Drowned Man is not a god." (The villagers hiss a reply.) "He came from the North, and to the North he will return." (Another reply.) "The North is too cold for gods." ("Too cold for gods," they intone delightedly.)\r\n\r\nFinally, they nod in agreement. The circle turns as one to grab one of their number, a man (or woman?) with a lamp. They carry him (or possibly her) to the precipice and hurl the flailing body over the edge, down into the oily black waves far below.\r\n\r\nTheir business done, the locals remove their robes and wander amiably back to town. They all seem quite jolly. Apparently the night's business went well. They retreat to the Cock and Magpie for a pint.

>>>	Description	"Please," wheezes a voice from within the mounds of clothing, "take it. I need to pay my debt." It seems that the clothes - mostly gloves, you see - are more wearing than being worn. The pale and sweating fellow within is a prisoner of his wardrobe! Take the report, though your fingers may shrink from the touch of the living cloth that binds him. Return it to London, and perhaps you'll help him pay what debt he owes.

The birth-cries are everywhere heard, as Clay Men sit up, opening incurious eyes, awaiting their tithing to London.\r\n\r\nThe Clay Broker waits on the quayside. On the flat palm of his broad hand, the Watchful Curio squats: but it is changed. "Our regards to Stone," is all he says.

>>>	Description	The Modiste stalks her prey past chittering rocks and wailing pools. Living shirts. Walking trousers. A lonely left shoe seeking a partner. All immediately rip and tear at even her exploratory cuts and stitches, their strange zest gone like the popping of a soap-bubble.\r\n\r\n"This will not do," she declares, discarding another reject. "Clearly, I must petition the King! If it is in his power to animate these miserable rags, he can certainly do a better job. Excuse me, Captain. I shall return presently."

The captain welcomes you with a clap on the back, and asks you what you'd like to drink on this happy occasion. Perhaps not so happy, you say...\r\n\r\nBy the end of your story, the captain and his zailors are all groaning in unison with the rest of Polythreme. Nevertheless, after he blows his nose into a demoralised handkerchief, he conveys his thanks, and passes you a small - but exceedingly noisy - reward. It should quiet once you leave the isle.
>>	Name	Warn some merchants about Wrack
>>	Description	The tavern patrons are so raucous, the sobbing of the cups seems well-behaved in comparison. Evidently, the zailors will soon travel Wrack on a lucrative contract...

>>>	Teaser	The Clay Men profess ignorance...
>>>	Description	The Clay Men profess ignorance. The benches wail too much to be sensible. But there is an ancient, long-winded harbour-wall that remembers. "THE HOUSE OF THE KEEL MADE EXILES OF THEMSELVES," it says in deep, crotchety tones. "THEY BOARDED THEIR SHIPS AND TOOK TO THE ZEE. THEN, FAR FROM LAND, THEY TOOK AXES THEIR SHIPS, SANK THEM, AND FOLLOWED THEM - MAN, WOMAN, CHILD - INTO THE DEPTHS. IN ABYSSES THEY BUILT THEIR FATHOMLESS CHURCHES, AND RESUMED THEIR WORSHIP OF LADY BLACK, SPIRIT OF THE DEEPS."\r\n\r\nThe Unsettled Salvager holds onto your arm for support as you walk back to your ship.

Let me give you some of my notes. And we will of course replenish your stores. Thank you so much."\r\n\r\nThe Cook darts eagerly into the prison as soon as the doors are opened.

>>>	Description	The Unctuous Fellow listens closely to your promises. At last he leads you into the heart of Wisdom, through five gates with locks of brass and iron, to the Governor's office.\r\n\r\nThe Governor sits rigid in a high-backed chair. His manner of dress is Khaganian; his face is concealed behind a smooth mask. He coughs frequently as you detail your Enigma, raising his gloved hand to his mouth. The room smells of mould and bat-guano.\r\n\r\n"That's (cough) enough," he says at last. "Choose your prisoner."
>>>	Name	An audience with the Governor
>>	Name	Exchange a Secret for a Prisoner
>>	Description	Wisdom has many, many secrets - far more than one might expect them to glean from the prisoners. But a discerning scholar might identify a secret which would tempt even the Governor of the prison. [This is unlikely to be profitable, unless you have someone specific in mind.]

>>>	Description	When you pass through the last gate of brass and iron, the Governor does not welcome you. He only sits, unmoving. You approach; he raises a hand - you leap to his desk, and rip off his mask.\r\n\r\nHullo! You've seen his scarred face elsewhere - Polythreme has a high bounty on his head, after he captured their vessels long ago, and led them to their doom in some forgotten escapade. The Governor roars, and pulls a pistol from beneath his desk; before he can fire, you relate the Sprightly Visionary's orders. He stands, knocking over his high-back chair. "I will begin gathering my men at once!" He bows deeply.
>>	Name	Unmask the Governor and present the summons to Hideaway

>>>	Teaser	You crumple the paper into a ball and throw it into the zee...

>>>	Teaser	He is convivial, the Unctuous Fellow...
>>>	Description	He is convivial, the Unctuous Fellow. He convives to the extent of a half-bottle of Greyfields First Sporing (a good thing you'd kept it for a special occasion). You have a pleasant chat about zee-weather and the loneliness of life out here in the Sea of Lilies; and he generously discounts the fee.
>>>	Name	"Oh, go on. I'm sure you'll bring me a replacement, some day."
>>	Name	Ransom a Prisoner
>>	Description	Wisdom will release prisoners, on payment of an eye-wateringly high redemption fee. It's not entirely clear whether this constitutes bribery, or a legal instance of Khaganian mercy. [This is unlikely to be profitable, unless you have someone specific in mind.]
>>>	Teaser	You make it up the prison walls, through the pipe, and straight into a cistern...
>>>	Description	You make it up the prison walls, through the pipe, and straight into a cistern. The splashing attracts guards. Their guns wreak havoc before you escape. The pipe-grating is repaired that same night. [Further rescue attempts are impossible.]
>>>	Name	Disaster!
>>>	Teaser	Up the walls, in the gaps between the search-lights...
>>>	Description	Up the walls, in the gaps between the search-lights. Into the outflow pipe, where the arm-thick bars have rusted enough for you to saw through. Down the corridors in silence, beneath bare light bulbs, past the cells where prisoners plead. One crew-member does, in fact, fall out of the pipe on his return, straight into the mouth of a knot-oracle. It munches him ruminatively while his twitching leg protrudes - rather like a farmer chewing an interesting straw. Unpleasant.\r\n\r\nStill, all things considered, it went rather well. It won't work a second time, though. They're already walling up the pipe.
>>>	Name	Success!
>>	Name	Rescue a Prisoner
>>	Description	Scale the walls. Enter through the outflow pipes. Evade the guards. Secure your rescuee without raising any alarms. Don't get eaten by giant toads. [You'll only get one chance at this. It is unlikely to be profitable, unless you have someone specific in mind.]

Two philosophers wait on you both, a little sulkily. The Enigmatic Gentleman will say nothing until you've both eaten dinner (a fine, if eclectic meal: cavern-trout, swamp-fruits, spices from Adam's Way and Whither, served on Delft ware at a lacquered Ming table). When you're done, he gives you a carefully itemised list of ship sightings, some excellent port and a little something to take away. "Remember me to the Admiral," he says fondly.

The third, you drive off a Khanate trimaran which has apparently taken a dislike to your kitchen garden, and shells your cucumbers into paste. Every fight takes its toll.

The second week, you suffer an assault by Unfinished Pirates. You crush them all to rubble. Now you have a rock garden. The third, a Khanate trimaran takes a dislike to your kitchen garden, and shells your cucumbers into paste. You capture it, rename it, make it the second vessel in your navy.\r\n\r\nExactly one week later, a Royal Navy corvette puts marines ashore to pacify your 'robber state'. You're ready for them. You send them home safe, and keep the corvette.\r\n\r\nOne month after that, the Empire asks leave to send an ambassador...\r\n\r\nThis is your kingdom. London is where you began - but now, this is your home. From a ship's captain to a nation's founder is a long journey indeed. Who knows where the journey will take you? [Congratulations!

It directs one head towards the ceiling where Storm waits, and one towards the depths of the sea. It directs the ruby eye-chips of its sixth skull towards the South, where Stone glows.\r\n\r\nIts seventh head butts against your ear, warm as granite in the sun. It murmurs Salt's Song.

>	Description	The silence will press on the ship with the weight of a cathedral, but we will pass the Song from mouth to mouth, and forge on, East. The zee around us will brighten further: forest-green, grass-green, green-and-gold. Mountains will rise ahead of us, flecked with light, their slopes veiled in forest. Mist will stream upwards from the zee. The beaches of that land ahead will be limned in silver like the painted moon. Our ship will beach, flawlessly and whole. She will never turn her prow homewards. I will sift the sand through my fist. I will lift my eyes to where the mountains rise, the loom and lilt of them, the sky where I will go. Salt is smiling.

The tea is hot and nutty and rather pleasant. She asks about your voyages: she is desperate for news of London, of its mists, its nights, its sick, its poor, its fires... She tactfully turns aside questions about the Convention, but she shares some of the secrets of the Neath.\r\n\r\n"Come and see me again," she says. "Next time you're here." She shrugs gracefully. "Bring me a present, if you like."

I would so love to get away from this ghastly little rock, back to where the souls glow and the dances never end…"\r\n\r\n"So listen. I have something more valuable for them.

When she hears what you have to say, she sinks down on the sofa.\r\n\r\n"Why did you have to spoil everything?" she complains. "And why - why are you warning me now? No, don't tell me. It'll be one of your human reasons. Compunction or compassion or one of those. What an untidy race you are."\r\n\r\nShe sighs. "Well, I owe you a double debt, don't I? You have done me both an ill turn and a good one. Here is an ill turn and a good turn for you. Goodbye. We won't see each other again."\r\n\r\nShe unlocks the ebony tallboy at the back of the room and hands you a mother-of-pearl music box. It plays a tinkling, dissonant tune that calls to mind something caged and wretched. All the way back to the ship, that tune tinkles in your thoughts, unlocking peculiar unhuman thoughts. You arrive back at the port filled with unhappy insights.

Your crew sit on deck at a long table lined with candles, eating a rich red feast. "A reckoning," one remarks, as she spears a gobbet of meat with her fork, "is not to be postponed indefinitely."

They give you a wide berth: something drips from your hands. Not blood. It's pale as milk. A bell tolls. You turn in through an ornate arch, and all the lights go out - but not before you see the spined shape throned in a pool at the chamber's heart.

There is the crack in the ceiling you know so well, and the chip on the bedpost. The covers float lazily off you. The darkness is abyssal, but your candles glow with St Brendan's fire. You swim to your window. London's streets are empty, and not as you remember them. Your favourite haunts are joined in a row, all within convenient walking distance. Silent, deserted; reserved only for you. Beyond them are houses centuries older, all abandoned.\r\n\r\nA playful current tugs at you. A familiar voice. You open your window, and allow the current to carry you to Lady Black's colonnaded palace. Perhaps today, her Ladyship will desire conversation, or a swim through her glowing gardens. Perhaps (you shudder) she has decided to resume the violin.  Or perhaps she merely wants to sit at her watery hearth in companionable silence.\r\n\r\nWhat would she do without you?\r\n\r\n[Your crew was plagued with strange dreams after you vanished forever into the zee.

A quincunx of carved stepped-towers rise over the walls and pour burning white light into the bleak sky. \r\n\r\nA rough, shadowed path leads from the docks to the Mirrored Gates of Varchas. Two towering carved-stone lamps throw their light on the angled mirrors, and a blue-cloaked Guard stands in the reflected pool of light. \r\n\r\nThe city is a beacon against the tree-hushed, sprawling darkness of the Elder Continent.

>>>	Description	The crew gathers before a backdrop of parabola-linen marked with stars and eyes. Their mood is jocular, sceptical, but anticipatory. They could use a show.\r\n\r\nThe Magician appears. His eyes are mirrors. (Lenses, no doubt!) He has four arms, like an Indian god. (Surrogates, like his hook, surely.) He exhales blue fire! (Alcohol vapour, probably.) He raises his arms, and the air is filled with golden petals. (Up his sleeve!) Vines leap from the deck, twine his legs, creep up past his waist. (Did he release narcotic vapours?) The air is filled with viric light, and the Neath-roof above trembles, seems to open to a sky with an orange sun. Long grasses rise around you. (Er...)\r\n\r\nIt's as if you wander in a meadow. Here and there your crew stand, chatting, laughing, eating fallen fruits. Rich juice runs down their chins. The sun is warm. Walls of jungle rise around you. Beneath your feet, the dark earth churns like the sea, and in the shadows of the undergrowth, serpents hiss like steam - but here, for a while, you are safe. Until you wake.\r\n\r\nYou wake. You are in your bunk: the ship is quiet around you, bar the throbbing of the engines that the Magician tends.

Between bites, he sips only water, evading all questions where opinion is sought.\r\n\r\nIt is only when the subject turns to his trade that something flickers inside him, old memories of pain and pride. "I fear it was my training that let me see the world for what it was - its corpus infested by malignancies with human faces. How could I dare face Hippocrates in the hereafter if I just stood by and did nothing? <i>Nothing!"</i>\r\n\r\nHis eye meets yours for the first time; fierce, damned. "If two drops of medicine can cure the body, could two drops of poison cure the world? For a moment, it actually seemed that easy."\r\n\r\nThe fire fades. He pushes back his chair.

For that sop to my conscience, I am most ashamed of all."\r\n\r\nThe wine flows as the Haunted Doctor talks candidly of his past - of a status that allowed him to the bedsides of many of London's most infamous, and the black medicine bag that carried the tools of both his trades - doctor, and anarchist-poisoner.\r\n\r\n"I was a fool," he adds. "A <i>child.</i> Just a boy on a crusade, drinking in the rhetoric of the Calendar Council, thinking myself more than a mere poisoner. What I did, I do not regret. Would though that I had seen their true hearts before giving myself so freely to perdition."\r\n\r\nHe raps his leather eyepatch. The sound is hollow; sickly. "It is a disappointment I well deserved.

>>>	Description	It is not with anger but curiosity that you ask him what he hoped to achieve by betraying your trust. What plans could the anarchs have that would upend the very table where the Great Game is played? In the privacy of your cabin you let him in on your little corner of it. More. You give him your blessing to make use of anything he sees, if he truly believes it will achieve something worthwhile.\r\n\r\nHe looks up. Pushes away the offered intelligence... which of course still has to be burned, as protocol demands. Something in his eye has gone, possibly forever. "You are right, of course. I will return to my duties. There at least I can still hope to serve."\r\n\r\n"Here. They gave me this in the Shadow. It is not fitting that I keep it. May you use it better than I would."

>>>	Description	By the last greasy flickers of a dying candle, you stand on deck with the Doctor and stare into the abyss. The question is not whether anything stares back, but whether it will choose to remain hidden. As you talk, the fellow's shoulders sink. He leans against the rail, considering the depths. Any arguments he might have made are swallowed by the emptiness.\r\n\r\nHe looks up. Something in his eye has gone, possibly forever. "You are right, of course. I will return to my duties. There at least I can still hope to serve."\r\n\r\n"Here. They gave me this in the Shadow. It is not fitting that I keep it. May you use it better than I would."

>>>	Description	Over a meal of zee-trout and wine, you do your best to bring him round. Is the world perfect? No. Neither Surface nor Neath will ever make that claim. Is all well in London? Hardly. He is not wrong there. However, you point out, he has a better chance than most to put his unquestioned skills to use in the name of <i>all</i> her people. And his regrets? Well, to do something terrible for one's country is barely a matter for shame at all!\r\n\r\nHe looks up. Something in his eye has gone, possibly forever. "You are right, of course. Perhaps I shall put about inquiries the next time we are in port. For now though, I will return to my duties. There at least I know that I can serve with a measure of honour."\r\n\r\n"Here. They gave me this in the Shadow. It is not fitting that I keep it. May you use it better than I would."

>>>	Description	The Doctor speaks with the knowledge of a dusty textbook, and the enthusiasm to match.

Your descent will take you directly into its dark, impossible pupil. Your lungs are bursting. You will wake, die, or both.

A long time ago, some rather careless people made these things to imprison Fingerkings. I'm not so careless. I can use it to enact my revenge on the 'king that took my hand." He is gloating. He actually strokes his moustache with his hook.\r\n\r\nHe retires to his cabin to investigate the serpent-image, but emerges a day later disappointed. "Different geometries," he explains obscurely.

>>>	Description	The Engineer has learnt a great deal about the powers and weaknesses of steel and fire and water. Once she must have been an extraordinary asset. But she can only express what she knows as poetry filtered through half-erotic visions. Roses and rivers and something like rain.

Blackboards, roughly scrubbed. Here is an old lunchbox - its half-eaten sandwiches encased in successive generations of exciting fungus.\r\n\r\nIn a rusted filing cabinet you find the documents you need: a folder of tea-stained research into zonar. You leave the rotting workshop quietly and return to your ship. The next time you sneeze, your handkerchief comes away black with the workshop dust that crept into your lungs.

>>>	Description	The shed is empty, saving a writing desk and the gigantic mass of needles. The Anxious Student snaps off the tip of one and twirls it between his fingers. "I hypothesise that the flukes have a method of absorbing and storing our lived experiences. It follows, therefore, that there should exist a means of transmitting - reliving! - that experience. Like so!" He stabs the needle through his palm. His eyes dull. \r\n\r\n"You heard Captain Harris, zailor. Target the Ogedei and fire torpedoes. And if you hit one of the Lorn Flukes then by God and Her Majesty I will put you out of the airlock and let the spiny b_____ds take you!"\r\n\r\nHe awakes from the reverie a moment later, beaming.

There's a heady scent of frankincense, and some sticky residue still clings to the bottom of the bowl.

After that come many verses that make no sense at all. \r\n\r\nThey go on and on about purple fires and upside-down houses; a fistful of roses the color of brandy, and dolls with buttons for teeth; the soft glossy pelt of an octopus and the sweet juice of a brazil nut.\r\n\r\nBy the end you are humming along to yourself.

>>>	Description	Disposing of the box is not too difficult. It makes a splash, chucked into the water, and there is a bubbling gleam from the depths as though more of the silver liquid is leaking out. But soon enough box and bubbles are out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe warehouse door closes too, with enough effort, and you even manage to get the lock locked again; a more difficult task than unlocking it in the first place.\r\n\r\nIt is the congealed metal on the ground that gives you trouble. It is very cold, very hard, and it has frozen in thin ragged slivers that threaten to cut your hands when you try to pry it up.\r\n\r\nIt is brittle, though, and you are able to smash it into flakes and pull the flakes away. At last you have done, and the scene looks no different than it did when you began.\r\n\r\nOnly when all that is done do you send someone up to the steepled building to ask for help.

She continues singing right up to the moment that she has to acknowledge you.\r\n\r\n"Leave the boxes - " \r\n\r\nShe stops, pushing the goggles away from her eyes. She has noticed, perhaps for the first time, that there are no boxes.\r\n\r\n"Deliveries come all the way up here," she says, before singing again.\r\n\r\nYou indicate that your crew is unaccustomed to that sort of work.\r\n\r\nShe looks as exasperated as a person can while continuing to sing about rabbit's feet and edible emeralds, but at last she says she'll see to it, if you can lead her servants to the correct landing.

>>>	Description	The lock is made of a thick heavy metal, and bitter cold to the touch. For some time you think you might fail, if the mechanism is actually frozen solid. But just when you think your pick is about to snap, the lock gives way.\r\n\r\nNot that it does you any good. The warehouse is so full already that when you open the door, a box falls out, glass shattering within. Pale silver liquid leaks around your feet and runs in rivulets over the stone of the path. A moment later it sets up, hard and cold as frost. \r\n\r\nSOOTHE & COOPER EXPORTS, says the stenciling on the boxes.

>>>	Description	The path is slippery and lined with mushrooms. You and the crew have to stop seven or eight times to set down the boxes and blow on your hands.\r\n\r\nThe closer you get, the less the building with the spire looks like a church. The walls are soot-blackened and made of brick. There are no windows, only narrow vents up near the roof. From these a low singing can be heard, a song so cheerful that your crew look at one another and frown. It is the song of someone keeping the monsters at bay.\r\n\r\nAt last you are close enough to bang on the door. \r\n\r\nAn Austere Acolyte answers it. She is dressed in black from head to foot. Her gloves are thick leather and her goggles are double glass.\r\n\r\n"Leave the boxes at the door," she says to you, and then she turns back toward the building, singing her song. Something about candied kittens and flaming violets and the coming of spring. Judging by the rhyme, she's inventing the words as she goes along.\r\n\r\nYou stop her and explain that you expect your extra work to be rewarded. She makes a grudging gesture, but complies.

It concerns the smell of hot brick, the chime of ashes falling on the grate, and the pleasure of braiding pokers together on a winter's night when there is nothing else to do. \r\n\r\nAt least, you think that's what it means. When you go back over the words in your head, you're not sure they make even that much sense.

>	Description	The Austere Acolyte directs the arrangement of the long box in the room under the steeple. \r\n\r\nThere are many other boxes there already, stacked in rows: three or four times as many as you have brought. In another corner of the room is a pile of wood from previous boxes already emptied and dismantled.\r\n\r\nSinging to herself about a mountain upholstered in velvet, she takes a crowbar to the box.\r\n\r\nThe corpse inside is permanently dead, in a way that the dead of London often are not. Not a drownie, not a tomb colonist, but not coming back, either. It looks pale and ordinary except for the slight distention of the skin over the breastbone. Gently the Acolyte presses there and nods (singing about tulips embroidered with yellow floss). \r\n\r\nShe lifts the body onto a marble slab. Without pause in her lyrics she prepares a scalpel. Your presence does not seem to bother her.

With a giant nutcracker, she cracks the sphere, and another sphere inside that, and another.\r\n\r\nFinally in the center she comes to something heavy, small, and black. She lifts it out with tongs and looks at it through her goggles. The song falters, but she manages to keep humming, though the words are lost.\r\n\r\nShe puts the black and heavy thing into a jar marked with a word of the Correspondence. She closes the jar and seals it with red wax.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the corpse is removed again and the marble slab wiped clean, she comes to pay you.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," she says.

Despite your keenest observation, you cannot work out how the sphere grew there or what it is for.\r\n\r\nWith a giant nutcracker, she cracks the sphere, and another sphere inside that, and another.\r\n\r\nFinally in the center she comes to something heavy, small, and black. She lifts it out with tongs and looks at it through her goggles. The song falters, but she manages to keep humming, though the words are lost.\r\n\r\nShe puts the black and heavy thing into a jar marked with a word of the Correspondence.

>>>	Description	The Austere Acolyte makes an incision over the distended place on the body, laying bare a heart-sized sphere of silver metal. It has grown there, apparently over many years, because the ribs of the corpse have curved around it without cracking. She has to break two of the ribs now to take out the ball. Behind it, the heart is intact but bloodless, its colour a milky grey.\r\n\r\nShe notices you watching, and halts her song just long enough to say, "They do not always grow in the same place, but over the heart is most common."\r\n\r\nWith a giant nutcracker, she cracks the sphere, and another sphere inside that, and another.\r\n\r\nFinally in the center she comes to something heavy, small, and black. She lifts it out with tongs and looks at it through her goggles. The song falters, but she manages to keep humming, though the words are lost.\r\n\r\nShe puts the black and heavy thing into a jar marked with a word of the Correspondence. She closes the jar and seals it with red wax.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the corpse is removed again and the marble slab wiped clean, she comes to pay you. Though she doesn't offer any further comment, she seems pleased by your careful attention during the autopsy, and almost smiles when she makes her payment. "A pleasure," she says. "Return another day: I may have something else for you."

They grow under his tongue. \r\n\r\nNone of them please the Acolyte. She drops all the black nodules into a sieve and picks through the collection with tongs, but in the end she throws them all away.

It is lodged like a peach pit between the halves of his brain, not perfectly spherical but squashed and lumpy.\r\n\r\n"It's a pity," she tells you afterward, pushing back her goggles. "It's such a flawless secret. You rarely see one of such high quality. He'd come to the unshakeable intellectual conviction that souls are only a kind of gaseous vapour. He didn't dare tell anyone for fear of losing his position, but he had too much integrity of mind to stop believing it merely because of the inconvenience. \r\n\r\n"Shame it's not the sort of thing the Masters are looking for."

>>>	Description	The secret grows in the gut of this one. It's surrounded by shell on shell on shell, but the thing itself is not much larger than a grain of sand.\r\n\r\nThe Austere Acolyte shakes her head. "It's really nothing worth telling. A childhood embarrassment!" she says in disgust. "Most people would have forgotten all about it."

>>>	Description	When the Austere Acolyte pulls the corpse's hands away from her chest, you see: the nodules grow in both palms, flattened ovals under the skin.\r\n\r\nThe Acolyte's big nutcracker struggles to get any purchase on these, dense and narrow as they are, but she manages in the end. She is singing about a beach of sugar sand, and an ocean of caramel.\r\n\r\nShe spends a long time with the goggles, and the song goes quiet then. \r\n\r\nWith a sigh the Acolyte throws the secrets aside. "She wanted to kill her sister's husband. She didn't commit the murder, but her hands itched to push him from the balcony of their townhouse."\r\n\r\nEven from here you sense the breathtaking hatred, as involuntary as lust. The precision of the murderous fantasies. Surprise, because she was not accustomed to such feelings. Fear at learning she was capable of them. Self-justification that such feelings were deserved. Heady excitement at having any emotion that ran so strong. Then hate again—\r\n\r\n"Your pony is made of fresh baked bread," sings the Acolyte in your ear. You're back in your body. You find yourself standing very close to the noxious black pellet, as though you were about to scoop it up and eat it.\r\n\r\n"...and butter is its saddle," she sings soothingly, leading you away to the far side of the room. There you sit until she has disposed of the thing, which is of no use to anyone.

The operation is quick, and the Acolyte plainly expects what she finds.\r\n\r\n"Thirty-five years in love with someone other than her husband, but she never said a word of it, and no one guessed, not even the lady in question."\r\n\r\nYou have learned by now to recognise the Acolyte's tone of voice when she's pleased.

The Acolyte has to cut into several parts of the Rubbery Corpse, because several things that look like strange lumps turn out to be ordinary Rubbery anatomy. At last she finds and extracts the piece.\r\n\r\nRather than the usual black lump, the Rubbery Man keeps his dark secrets in amber form.

It takes a long time to carve it out. \r\n\r\nThe Acolyte tells you, when she can: how, when a certain government was deposed, the woman and all her family were thrown out of their houses and made to walk in winter two hundred miles to another country. How her baby brother died on the road. How she came to another country, and married, and never told her children or her grandchildren what she had seen, because she did not want to poison them with grief.\r\n\r\nNot a story for the Masters, but more steel than you've ever seen in one body before.

>>>	Description	The smithy is a long low building that you missed on your first survey of the island. The blacksmith works, it proves, entirely in heart-metal, though it is so hard and cruel that it wears his tools out quickly.\r\n\r\n"Nothing like it for weaponry," he says. "Does more damage than any ordinary steel, and a little bit of the shrapnel will give you trouble to the end of your days."

>>>	Description	It might not be enough for a royal concert, but it's a good, hearty tune that would put anyone in a better mood. You try singing it with various invented lyrics about a kite made of pantaloons and a clock that can only strike thirteen. The tune holds up, and you're sure that the Austere Acolyte's broader and more varied verses will go with it just as well.\r\n\r\nWhen you whistle it for her, she seems really quite touched.

You quickly learn better than to touch it, or even go very near it. The cumulative misery of so many lives is dizzying if you even look in the general direction. You keep your eyes out to sea instead.

>>>	Description	The place proves to be a wide field knee-deep in the dark matter, thousands of hearts' worth. Looking too closely at it makes you dizzy. Looking too far away from it makes you a poor watchman. It makes for an uncomfortable couple of hours, pacing around the dumping ground, which runs all the way down to the beach.\r\n\r\nIn the last quarter of the watch, there's stealthy movement, a rowboat, three hooded figures.

But these stones were lost beneath more than the sea: they are half-encased in a smooth translucent orange substance, like amber...\r\n\r\nEven as you watch the ruins groan and shiver. The convulsions that brought them up will soon take them below again.

>>>	Description	You and your crew swarm over the ambery stuff with hammers and chisels, smashing off hunks and chunks. It powders easily (emitting an unexpected lemony fragrance) and the rising sea washes quantities of it away - but you fill pockets and sacks with it. At last a rumble rises from below - the amber shudders - and you all scramble clear as it sinks back into the deep. The waters close over it with a tremendous roar and show of foam.
>>>	Name	A half-gold haul

>>>	Description	You squeeze through the fissures in the amber shell to explore the ruins within - but almost at once, the earth begins to rumble, and the ruins to sink. You scramble clear, but the amber snaps shut like a clam as you scramble clear, catching a zailor from Spite by the ankle. She screams a thin, tearing, desperate scream and struggles to free herself: in vain. The waters close over the ruin as it sinks, and the screaming ends abruptly.
>>>	Name	A horrid end
>>>	Teaser	You squeeze through the fissures in the amber shell to explore the ruins within...
>>>	Description	You squeeze through the fissures in the amber shell to explore the ruins within. The dwellings are low and windowless - thick-walled, flat-roofed - like those in desert countries. Nothing like anything in the Neath. You find shattered pots, glass beads, and bones, all mired in amber.\r\n\r\n"Something wrong about these bones - " one of your zailors mutters uneasily, a seasoned woman with a little surgeon's training. She's right. The shape of the skull is not precisely human: the arms-bones have splayed out like twigs off a branch. Another exclaims as he finds the bones of a small animal, coiled together like a knot of serpents. \r\n\r\n"Shapelings!" someone hisses - you think that's what they say - but none of your crew will admit to speaking.\r\n\r\nThere's a rumbling from below. You all scramble desperately for the exits in the amber casing, squeezing through one by one, just in time. The amber snaps shut and the ruins sink again beneath the waves with a tremendous roar and show of foam.

Nothing like anything in the Neath. You find shattered pots, glass beads, and bones, all mired in amber.\r\n\r\nAmong the rest you find a shining black haematite ornament the size of two fists: a bulbous thing, graven with concentric circles. Stubby protrusions, crudely worked, hang below like wax driblets. You realise, as you turn it in your hand, what it looks like: one of the domes of the great Echo Bazaar in London.\r\n\r\n"Something wrong about these bones - " one of your zailors mutters uneasily, a seasoned woman with a little surgeon's training.

The Devil listens, fingers steepled, to your story, nodding encouragingly. "That's terribly helpful of you. Terribly helpful. Could I have the message, please?" He reads it with interest. "Oh, that's very good. Allow me to offer a consideration to you. Here. For your trouble. Bring me more, and I'll give you something else.

Very senior indeed. She wants to come home, eh? Well, either she's telling us straight, in which case Brimstone will have her baked in a pie, or she's trying to swindle us, in which case, well, I'd like her here so I can warm up my own pie-oven. Either way, yes, the time has come. Bring her here, will you? We'll pay her fare. Thank you so much. You've advanced the cause of Hell today."

>>>	Description	The Urbane Devil meets you and the Deviless by one of the Embassy's lesser entrances. He bows; she bows; they chatter together in one of Hell's hissing, clicking languages, and laugh at a shared joke.\r\n\r\nFor a moment you seem forgotten, but she turns back. To thank you? No: to pay you. "All shall be well, now," she says gleefully, "and all manner of thing shall be well. You've done a terrible thing, and I am terribly grateful. Take this."\r\n\r\n"This" is a smouldering ruby from the throat of Mt Palmerston. It is scorching hot from her touch. She chuckles fondly as you juggle it hastily from hand to hand. "Perhaps I'll see you again. You're so much fun."

>>>	Description	Two stinking goat-demons shamble up: one takes each of the Deviless' arms. She looks at you, and her face writhes into an expression that a human face could not support. Hatred? Satisfaction? Admiration? Something of those, and another emotion, a hot flat reptilian one that only devils understand. "Goodbye," is all she says. The goat-demons guide her down a flight of iron steps, to the basement entrance of the Excruciation Annex.\r\n\r\nThe Urbane Devil lounges by one of the Embassy's ornamental lamps, picking his teeth with a splinter of purplish crystal. "Bravo! And that concludes our business. Here." He hands you a flat parcel wrapped in coppery crêpe paper, and bounds off, whistling.\r\n\r\nThe parcel contains a beautifully rendered oil-painting of the Deviless, in a gown with a ruffled collar which suggests the sixteenth century. Her eyes are closed.

>>>	Description	She complains that you have only human spirits, not the cloying poisonous stuff that devils favour, but she drinks it liberally regardless. She seems more wistful than usual: regretting her departure from Mount Palmerston, or nervous about what lies ahead? Finally you realise that she's drunk. She's saying something about the old days -\r\n\r\n"... we built our hives on the edge of dream," she slurs, "while men were monkeys still. Monkey-souls are poor unripe things - like this wine of yours - but they serve as consolation. I require consolation, [q:Addressed As]. I do."\r\n\r\nShe looks directly into your eyes. "You're very pretty," she says. Then she falls face-down in the remains of her chops and stewed mushrooms, and begins to snore.

A complicated three-way battle commences! The Chelonians flee when their leader falls, and the Khaganians withdraw in good order. You find enough loot on the corpses to consider the occasion a victory. The Chelonian leader's eyes are strange: the colour of the deepest zee, more beast than human...

>>>	Name	A proud Imperial victory

>>>	Teaser	"Here and there," she says...
>>>	Description	"Here and there," she says. It's not that she's trying to be coy. You don't think she much cares about the answer. "Most are from the Surface, one way or the other."\r\n\r\nYou think that is all she's going to say on the matter, but after a long time, she adds, "It's an old trade. They've been coming this way for generations, to judge by the piles out back. The Masters made the arrangement."
>>>	Name	A matter of indifference
>>	Name	Ask where the corpses come from
>>	Description	If you're to be involved in the trade, wouldn't it be better if you knew?
>>>	Teaser	"Soothe and Cooper's Heartsease Tonic," she says...
>>>	Description	"Soothe and Cooper's Heartsease Tonic," she says. "Take it when you're sad. Take it when there's something you don't dare speak about. Take it with wine or with laudanum, or take it straight from the bottle. It goes down warm, but it turns cold in the body. It forms around the thing you don't want to say, and holds it in."\r\n\r\nFrom there her explanation becomes more iatrotheological in nature. There's something about the reaction of souls with a compound of silence and grief, and something about the circulation of the blood. She appears to believe these points explain why the metal sets hard, and why it takes different shapes in different bodies, and why some users find it necessary to keep drinking tonic all their lives until the balls have grown as large as organs.
>>>	Name	Growth
>>	Name	Ask how the metal balls are formed

>>>	Description	"The useful ones go to the Masters, and everything else to the dump," she says. "That's the purpose of all this. Wouldn't be needed otherwise."\r\n\r\nThe topic makes her nervous. She doesn't look at you, but she is twisting her hands together. \r\n\r\nBetween her glove and her sleeve is a web of old white scars, as though her skin had frozen and cracked and healed again. She pulls the sleeve into place when she sees you looking.

>>>	Teaser	She tells you she can't recall how she got here...
>>>	Description	She tells you she can't recall how she got here. She remembers what happened in London, and then there's a gap, and then her first memories of this place are of the shape of the steepled building, looming through the dark.\r\n\r\n"This comes from before," she says, drawing back her protective clothing. Between her glove and her sleeve is a web of old white scars, as though her skin had frozen and cracked and healed again. She pulls the sleeve back down after a moment.

>>>	Description	The hall is dark. The parlour, too. There are signs of disturbance here and there - a smashed cup, an overturned piano-stool, scratches on the walls. You bend to pick up a page of paper and hold it to the light. It is an unfinished poem. You think the handwriting may be Phoebe's. The 'absent moon', the 'gnawing hunger in the heart'. The well. The sea. A great many crossings-out.\r\n\r\nThere are sounds from downstairs, from the kitchen. You push open the door, cautiously. Something clings to the ceiling: something turns yellow eyes to you and hisses.
>>>	Name	Words in darkness

>>>	Description	Your story starts out well: a sibling born under mysterious circumstances, the midwife going mad, your parents keeping you out of the baby's room. Laudanum bottles accumulating in the hallway. Specially commissioned rat-fashioned baby toys designed not to break under any amount of stress.\r\n\r\nBut at some point, perhaps during the portion about the tentacles, you lose the confidence of your listener.\r\n\r\nThe Austere Acolyte gives a little huff and turns away. "If you didn't want to tell me the truth, you could have just said so."
>>>	Name	A bit flat
>>>	Teaser	You start with the thing in the cradle...
>>>	Description	You start with the thing in the cradle. Sucker marks left behind on your mother's arm. The midwife's disappearance. The ciphered message in the news the next day. What happened to your father's leg. The false story before the magistrate, and the bishop's intervention. The charitable funds collected under illegitimate pretenses.\r\n\r\nThe tale has everything: the sordid, the blasphemous, the biologically bizarre. \r\n\r\nThe Acolyte listens to it with utter fascination. It is hard to tell whether she is convinced or merely spellbound by the power of your story, but for your purposes, either will do.

>>>	Teaser	The more you concentrate, the less sense it makes...
>>>	Description	The more you concentrate, the less sense it makes. There are two or three ideas clear enough to hang on to, but the rest is imponderable. You are not sure that what the Acolyte says is even true.
>>>	Name	But if the artery grows there, then...
>>>	Teaser	The explanation chimes with certain things you've heard before...
>>>	Description	The explanation chimes with certain things you've heard before. The fructification of the lungs under stress. The case of the woman with the steel spine.

>>>	Name	No comment
>>>	Teaser	She looks away from you, into the glass of mushroom wine...
>>>	Description	She looks away from you, into the glass of mushroom wine.\r\n\r\n"There's a story I heard when I first apprenticed here," she says. "That there was someone who worked here who swallowed one of the black pellets, and it made them impervious to grief. There was nothing they could see that was worse than what they already knew."\r\n\r\nShe pours some of the wine out for you. "I think that would be a great strength to have, don't you?"

>>>	Description	She smiles; she lowers her eyes; she is obviously not surprised. The environment is perhaps not very comfortable for this sort of thing, but you make do.\r\n\r\nLater, much later, when you hear her singing at her work again, it's all about a wax shepherdess melting in the fields, and the humid kiss of a steam locomotive. You choose to see this as a compliment.

>>>	Description	He tells you that folk here keep to themselves. He says he doesn't go to up to the building with the steeple, and the acolytes hardly ever come down here. It sounds like a solitary sort of life. He claims he prefers it that way.\r\n\r\nWhen he turns back to his work, you see the chain of heartmetal links he wears around his neck, and the closed locket that hangs from it.

"Walk around where people are, safe enough, if I just have something to keep the grief out."\r\n\r\nAfter that the conversation gets into intricacies of engineering. He draws you a sketch of how the wrist joint will have to be made, the skin oiled and covered with a fine foil of beaten heartmetal.

>>	Description	Pretend you heard a rumour about it, if you don't want to admit to snooping.

>>>	Description	For seven days the smith works. Only the Cannoneer is permitted within. Your zailors place bets on whether they'll blow themselves up, and whether the explosion will eradicate Station III as well.\r\n\r\nThere are no explosions. At last the Cannoneer opens the smithy door, grinning: a tired, but dazzling, grin. He gestures to the Seal: the armature that now constrains it is meshed with silvery heartmetal. The glyphs flicker frantically, like trapped insects. The weapon emits a constant, low, barely audible growl. The air in the room is stiflingly hot.\r\n\r\n"Behold!" the Cannoneer says. "The Memento Mori!"\r\n\r\nThe grin dissipates. "It's... finished. I'm not sure what to do now." [Mount the Memento Mori on your ship, or sell it to one of the warlike zee-nations. Some will give you better prices than others. You may tilt the balance of power on the zee.]
>>>	Name	A shining horror
>>	Name	Ask the smith to construct an assembly-housing for the Cannoneer's weapon
>>	Description	Why is the smith so willing to help? Just how many outstanding favours are owed? The Cannoneer shrugs the question off, smiling. "I made a lot of bombs, back in the day. A lot of bombs. For a lot of people. Who don't like me to talk about it!! I think that's why the University threw me out. I never dared go back and ask, though."
>>>	Teaser	There might be something interesting behind one of these doors, but you've picked the wrong one...

>>>	Name	Drills and polish
>>>	Teaser	Heavy cannon...
>>>	Description	Heavy cannon. Harpoons of a metal wicked enough to pierce the most rubbery hide. Sheets of flat heartmetal suitable for hammering onto the hull of a vessel. Grapeshot of heartmetal fragments. Some of the inventory is already packed for export.\r\n\r\nIn the last of all the rooms is a dress-maker's dummy. It wears a diver's outfit of oiled skin, which looks about the smith's own size, covered all over with overlapping scales of heartmetal. \r\n\r\nOn the shelf beneath is a right-hand glove of the same design. But the suit is as yet incomplete.

White crickets buzz in the weeds. A shiver of wind passes, and then the air is still, with that absence of chill that passes for warmth down here. Two zailors compare tattoos. Your head swims pleasantly with the wine.

>	Description	Then she tells you what happened before. She was a doctor, healing the malaise of countesses and publishing research about the applications of mushroom-derived spirits.\r\n\r\nHer twin lived with her, at her expense, but preferred more bohemian entertainments. The Acolyte describes what their life together was: sepia anatomical charts next to dream-animals done in viridian paint. Prisoner's Honey jostling retorts full of medicine. Silk scraps in the bandage drawer. \r\n\r\nThe twin is gone now: something about an accident, a footbath full of silvery fluid, skin cracked and frozen. A resuscitation attempt that went wrong, preventing any return from death. \r\n\r\nAfterward her memories are blurred, until they pick up again here. She regards her present occupation as penance of some kind.

The red of the place gets into your vision. The faces of your crew seem flushed, as if fevered. You hear your own breathing echo raggedly. No one is sitting in the pew behind you.

>>>	Description	They're singing to themselves and carrying lenses of some sort, and they know enough to be looking through the most recent part of the pile. It's plain someone's tipped them off about a particularly juicy scandal that has just lately been discarded. \r\n\r\nFrom the whispers in the dark you even have some idea what it is.

>	Description	She breaks the locks and pries off the lid. \r\n\r\nThe body inside is her own: or rather, it has her nose, her cheekbones, her long fingers. Its hair is longer and something about its eyes make it appear more dissolute. But it is, or at least it could be, her twin. \r\n\r\n"Her death was my fault," says the Acolyte bleakly. "So of course she's come back to me."

>>>	Description	The growth is not in such a difficult place that she has any difficulty finding it, but the Acolyte works slowly and grimly. She talks angrily to the corpse.

>>>	Name	Snapped sympathy
>>>	Teaser	You offer a reasoned argument...
>>>	Description	You offer a reasoned argument. She doesn't want to listen, at first. She moves the body to its marble slab and lays out her array of scalpels. But while you talk, she does not begin the incisions, and after a time she lays down the blades and slumps beside the marble table.\r\n\r\nIt is a long evening. She weeps. She cleans up the body and puts it in clean clothes. You help her wrap it in silk and return it to its coffin. \r\n\r\nSome other servant of the Masters can investigate, but this task is not for her.

>	Description	When the Acolyte gets to the center, she pushes the ball towards you. As an afterthought she lets you borrow her goggles as well.\r\n\r\nThe secret, when you can focus enough to make it out, is this:\r\n\r\nThe Austere Acolyte's twin was not her twin, not her sister at all. The Acolyte never had a sister. This being took up wearing a mirror of her face, early in her childhood. It was drawn by her early promise, by the likelihood of her success.
>	Name	Shades of Black
>>>	Teaser	The news does not comfort her...
>>>	Description	The news does not comfort her. When she hears it, she takes the scalpel back up and continues the autopsy, dismantling the corpse down to the small organs. She won't talk. She won't sing. \r\n\r\nThe pellet of dark matter sits on its tray.

>>>	Name	Insufficient invention

>>>	Description	You come up with something vague but soothing about a long-running weakness of the heart, a medical concern the twin did not dare confide even to her clever doctor sister because it could not be healed. You tell how the twin loved her sister so much that she did not want to let the Acolyte to feel guilty when, inevitably, true death came for her. \r\n\r\nYou tell it with some pauses, hesitation, restraint, as though all these strange feelings were true and were even your own. As though you were the one who did not want to see the Acolyte hurt.\r\n\r\nThe Acolyte weeps gratefully. You help her wrap the body again for disposal and you put the pellet aside, with tongs, to go to the dump. Nothing messy is left behind.

You light it in your cabin, and wait in the wardrobe with the cabin door ajar.\r\n\r\nHere comes the Snuffer, eyes aglow like covetous lamps through the holes in its stolen face, tip-toeing into your cabin. Step out behind it. Smash its horrible skull in with a gaff-hook. Have your crew fling it in the sea, in case it somehow revives. And there's an end of it.\r\n\r\n(Unless there's a second Snuffer aboard.)

>>>	Teaser	You meet beneath the flare of the last bridge glim-lamps...
>>>	Description	You meet beneath the flare of the last bridge glim-lamps. In this half-light, with its stolen face askew, it's hard to imagine how it ever deceived you. It's as strong as strangling kelp, and its breath stinks of blood and hot flint. But you bear it down, wear its resolve away, skewer it through the heart with your boot-knife.\r\n\r\nRoll it overboard. Watch it bob away into the dark. Now you need to work out how to get home.

Somehow, the pair of you establish a tenuous trust. It seems you are both, in fact, people, and the people-eating thing has gone. No trace of it remains... but a life-boat is missing. Something drove it to abandon you.

>>	Name	Spare him
>>	Description	It's just possible that the Snuffer has already left the ship: that you're both human. You could lay down your arms, and trust the other zailor.
>	Teaser	"Here! - 
>	Description	"Here!" a zailor shouts. There's something nestled in the mossy crook of a grey-leafed tree. A wooden serpent, lacquered with black, red and yellow. Its eyes are garnet flakes. "That'd fetch a good price at the Bazaar," the zailor observes. "But it has a cursy look," points out another.\r\n\r\nThis has all happened before, exactly like this. Are you losing your mind?

>>>	Description	You smash the serpent, and pick up one splintered piece, to show your crew... for your crew are watching, eyes wide and silver. "By this victory," you say - you hardly know why - "I claim the rights to the sight of this place." Your crew mutter and disperse, slinking into serpent-shape to wriggle across the clearing. The tree where you found the image is one of many: you stand in a jungle beneath an orange sun...\r\n\r\nThe air flickers, and instead you stand in your cabin, in your night-clothes. Instead of a splintered fragment of wooden serpent, you hold a paint-brush. In front of you is a painting of jungle, clearing, crew, serpent, you. Somehow you've done good work in your sleep - and you've mixed familiar oils into a peculiar vivid green.\r\n\r\nRub the sleep from your eyes, sign the painting, and try not to worry.

"You should have left me," is all that she will say, for the longest time. \r\nHer face is horribly burned. She goes bandaged, after, like the half-dead of the tomb-colonies.

The Clay Man's huge hands enfold the box.\r\n\r\n"There," the Mechanic says, turning to you. "A serpent-trap. Now, I can sleep. I can finally sleep." He smiles.

A pattern of embroidered suns runs along the collar, but the gold thread is dull. The kohl around her eyes is smudged.\r\n\r\n"Well, Taamas," she asks. "Are you going to ask your questions? Or are you just going to stare?"\r\n\r\nHer tone is brusque but her expression is curiously eager; you do not think Varchas receives many visitors.

She fixes you with an admonishing look, and adds: "It is very ill-mannered to pretend you still have one."\r\n\r\nYou begin to see, a little, why Varchas is not often visited.

"If we let darkness corrupt us we would not be Varchaasi any longer, but Taamas. Like you."\r\n\r\nYou wonder, is that so terrible a fate? Her mocking laugh answers you even before her words do: "Yes, it would be terrible indeed, Taamas. And before you ask," she adds. "No, I do not have any desire to leave Varchas. The rest of Neath has fallen from Mihir's grace, and I have no wish to join them!"

Your head pounds.\r\n\r\nIt is a few minutes before your eyes adjust, and you can look around: brass lamps and gilded sconces hang from every wall, and phosphorescent fungus grows moss-like upon doorways and ceilings. \r\n\r\nCunningly arranged mirrors catch every droplet of light and diffuse it till each cobblestone and rampart of the city is drenched and blazing and utterly without shadow.\r\n\r\nWho do you speak to?

"I'm the Keeper of the Western Principal Mirror," she points up at the enormous multi-faced mirrors set atop each of the city's five Towers. "I'm only here because I'm looking for my idiot brother. He is probably busy pouring wine down some pretty, dark-eyed boy's throat in a tavern."\r\n\r\nIs it a matter of great urgency, you wonder? "He's late for his lamp-checks in the Sacred District," is her terse reply, as she hurries away. "If the Agnihotri found out, he'd be lucky to end up a lake-dredger."

Or is that what your nose is naturally like?"\r\n\r\nOver your protestations, he gives you directions to the Hospital. "Oh the medics are all butchers, to be sure, but they walk in the light of Mihir," he adds breezily, and then points out the Guard House and the vague direction of the Temple of Mihir, and a street of bars and gaming-houses. "We don't want to get a reputation for being inhospitable!"\r\n\r\nHe laughs, as if he has made a grand joke, and you laugh along weakly.

"I have to take this load all the way to the Sacred District, and the priests don't like if if I'm late."\r\n\r\nYou inquire politely about her cough, and she looks suddenly terrified. "Mihir look down on me," she mumbles. "Please don't say anything! I have a family to feed!"\r\n\r\nWith that, she grabs the handles of the cart and pulls away at a run. Within a few moments you have lose sight of her in the crowded pathways. What an odd woman.

"My friends and I would be honoured if you would attend a small gathering with us, Taamas.

Then, she points down and sweeps her hand up to her heart. She takes a few sidesteps before throwing her hands into the air. What could she be saying?

How's the food?"\r\n\r\nThe Visionary writes a message in the notebook chained to his wrist. He presents it to you both: '<i>Welcome. Sorry, must run. You need to register yourself - go straight ahead. Advice: no questions. Befriend Temtum. Good day.</i>'

>>>	Description	Together, you roll the wheel through Hideaway. You pass women lugging blow torches and bags of cement, and men trying to smile as they put on diving suits. Eventually you pass through an iron gate to a work room.\r\n\r\nAt the room's centre is a deep pit. A large electrical alternator looms against the back wall. The Visionary plugs the cable into the alternator, and slowly feeds the rest down into the pit. When finished, he writes a short message in the notebook chained to his wrist. '<i>Thank you. Usual help's working on faulty line. May need you in future.</i>' As he hands you the note he looks up, revealing his neck. It's one huge scar.

>>>	Description	On the night of the festival, you join the dwellers of Hideaway around a large wooden model of Temtum placed in the festival square. Some people exchange shrugs; others twiddle their thumbs politely. Eventually, the Impolite Investigator appears on a balcony overlooking the square. He shouts a hello; the dwellers wince, but maintain their customary smiles. \r\n\r\n"Hideaway," he shouts, "is doomed. This is a biological fact. Temtum has already begun to outgrow his shell, our home. Everyone needs to evacuate, before..." He gives you a nod: you set the model ablaze, and it begins to crack apart and fall to ruin. The dwellers scream. \r\n\r\nThe Sprightly Visionary turns his back on the spectacle and walks away. He taps a few cablemen on the shoulder; they follow him. The rest of the people of Hideaway stands idly, watching the wooden city crack and burn.

These balls of flesh are apparently art! It takes some time for her to convey more about the artwork. One lump is a smaller version of the beast who carries the city, although missing a shell.

You, and no more than three zailors, are invited to dine with them that evening.\r\n\r\nAnd you do: on black laver-bread and overcooked cavern-trout, among fierce women with spiked rosaries. One of them hacks up her trout with an axe. But at the end of the evening, when the plates are cleared away, the room goes quiet.

"If I can learn to fight. Thank you, for bringing me here. It might be what I want. Goodbye: and take this.

Shrieks, like the tearing of sheet metal, like the fission of thought. A terrible silence. One final, furious shriek! The glass in the bridge windows cracks like ice. Abbey Rock is silent.\r\n\r\nThe Prioress arrives a half-hour later. Her eyes are shining. "She scarred it," she says delightedly. "Oh, how she scarred it! We'll lay her to rest in our own crypt. We'll write her name on our wall. The next novice who joins us will be named for her. She scarred it! Thank you. And she wanted you to have this."\r\n\r\nIt's her pistol, silver-chased, drenched in black and stinging blood. As you watch, the blood wisps in choking vapour from the metal, leaving it stained dark as the zee.
>>>	Name	An ending
>>	Name	Don't watch
>>	Description	The fire is lit. The smoke of printed love-stories rises into the dark. The Sisters chant in a language older than London. They play a wistful, halting music on harps and lyres. The Adventuress has had her uniform ironed. Even her buttons are polished. Her knife is ready in her left hand, and her pistol in her right. Far above, in the deep night of the Neath, something briefly occludes the light of the false-stars.\r\n\r\n"Go back to the ship," she says abruptly. "I don't want you to see me die. Please."

"I once swore," she remarks, "to kill nothing that flies. I hope I break that oath." They will be her last words.\r\n\r\nA piece of star-specked night falls shrieking from the roof! The bonfire is quenched in an instant, but a gout of flame from the pistol punctures the dark: once, again. The night is screaming now, deep rending cries that are almost words. The scent of ice and ozone is overpowering. You reach out a hand, blindly. The darkness deepens, but a Sister takes hold of your shoulder. "Stay away!" she hisses.\r\n\r\nThe Adventuress cries out. So does the night. This last shriek squeezes your skull and rakes your brain and tears the words from your throat. It cracks the cobblestones of the Abbey yard. In the flames of a final shot, you glimpse a crested wave of night rearing above the Adventuress. Its wings are the sky. Its horns and vanes blaze with scars. It strikes - it convulses - it whirls, and it's gone. Your eyes are hazed with frost, but as it rises - you are quite certain - it lurches to the side, as if one of its wings had suffered a blow...\r\n\r\nOn the cracked cobbles at your feet lies the Adventuress, dead eyes staring. Beside her lies her pistol, silver-chased, drenched in black blood. As you watch, the blood wisps in choking vapour from the metal, leaving it stained dark as the zee.

Down in the hold are orderly piles of crates, boxes, and cabinets. \r\n\r\nEventually you uncover a detailed set of schematics that - despite the complexities of Khanate script - look like what you need. You cram them into your jacket. \r\n\r\nYou have discovered fingerprints in the dust, and suspicious gaps in the runs of certain records. Has someone been here recently?

"We probably won't find her here," the Heir says. "I don't expect to. I don't believe in clinging to specific hopes and expectations of that kind; it's just the sort of obsession that ruins lives, just the kind of thing I'm always having to repair..."\r\n\r\nYou don't find the ship, though you walk the docks three times over.

Should have already shed its shell, but I guess it's willing itself to hold on. It can't beat biology though, can it! It's going to outgrow Hideaway. Soon." He drags himself from the bed.

It is bruised; bloodied, in some places. In others, it's mere feet from the shell. The Investigator points ahead, to a thick cable, hanging down from above. As it comes more clearly into view, it sparks. The charge results in a twitching of Temtum's flesh. You return to the city as swiftly as you can, but your crew is caught by Temtum's shifting body, and crushed between his shell and his flesh. As soon as you're back in Hideaway, the Investigator strips out of his diving suit and flees.

It is a handsome stone mansion arranged around a pleasantly cool courtyard: frescoes of city-life are painted on the walls. Given how few visitors Varchas hosts, you suspect the Inn is more usually used by philandering locals.\r\n\r\nEvening falls - or does it? The town's Five Principal Mirrors are mounted on coiled-spring mechanisms, and alter their angles subtly to create the impression of evening. Across the city, the Fire-Keepers throw pinches of coloured powder into the lamps and the quality of light yellows to a softer brightness.

>>>	Description	The Inn's Cook makes thick spiced stews of fungus-flowers and lotus-root, eaten with chunks of boiled cassava and rice imported from inland. But it is the light-hungry fruit grown in the city which makes your mouth water.\r\n\r\nTart-scented oranges and bruise-yellow bananas, pineapples bursting with juice, tender coconuts with the silky white flesh scooped out and sap-sweet on the tongue.\r\n\r\nDo you not eat meat, you ask in wonderment, and the Inn's Cook calls to Mihir for strength. "It is forbidden to eat the flesh of living creatures," he says. Lucky the Varchaasi don't fancy the zee-faring life.

Perhaps a candle-lit dinner and a genteel seduction; it turns out to be an evening of card-games and chilled wine with his rather eclectic collection of friends.\r\n\r\nBut as the wine is drunk and the cards are played, the gathering takes on a certain <i>political</i> tone. A raggedly dressed Artisan begins complaining of the Agnihotri's trade restrictions; a Novice Priest points out contradictions in Mihir's mantras; a Stone-Carver questions whether his daughter should also have to follow in the same profession.\r\n\r\n"Will you," the Jewel-Turbaned Youth stares at you, licking his lips, "will you tell us <i>a story</i>?"

"We were hoping," the Jewel-Turbaned Youth clears his throat, "that you would tell us, um," he pitches his voice lower, "<i>lies</i>."\r\n\r\nYou are a little insulted; after all, it's not as if you make a habit of telling strangers of your past!

The Novice Priest presses his forehead to the ground and prays desperately for Mihir to forgive him.\r\n\r\nThe Jewel-Turbaned Youth embraces you tightly, and you can feel the pounding of his heart against your own. "Your story was like being touched by darkness," he whispers in fascinated revulsion. "It has made me apostate.

Around the Temple sprawls the Sacred District: vine-covered stone shrines; still ponds glowing with algae and flash-finned carp; priests in white, their wrists heavy with metal chains.\r\n\r\nThere are no mirrors in the Temple of Mihir. The rest of the city has to make do with mirrored light and reflection but Mihir's most sacred space is filled with hundreds of lamps and lit candles of hard-packed phosphorescent fungus.

Should priests curse in temples? "I cannot believe the Taamas are so ignorant."\r\n\r\nYou assure him that you are indeed quite ignorant, and wait patiently for him to finish another, more inventive round of cursing. "There are dreadful powers in mirrors," is his unhelpful conclusion.\r\n\r\nHe gives you a charm of bloodied snakeskin and scraps of paper written in an angular, unfamiliar script, and tells you to hang it upon the nearest mirror before you sleep.

>>>	Description	In the first panel, Mihir is depicted as the sun, beaming rays of thinly hammered gold onto a Surface city both peaceful and prosperous. The Five Towers are carved with loving detail, barely recognisable without the wreaths of fungal-flowers and curling vines. In the next panel Mihir blinks, and the city turns to shards of onyx and jet, slowly crumbling away.\r\n\r\nMihir then becomes a broad-shouldered, sorrow-faced man stalking the false-starred blackness of the Neath in search of his lost city. His eyes are picked out in orange-red carnelian, and seem lit with inner fire. \r\n\r\nVarchas as-it-is-now is conspiciously absent from the carvings, as if the Stone-Carvers could not bear to chip its Fallen outlines. 
>>	Name	The Bas-Reliefs
>>	Description	Every surface of the temple is carved and worked; if you peer closer, the bas-reliefs depict Varchas's Fall into the Neath.

>>>	Description	You go to pay your respects, and he is at pains to impress upon you that he is no despot or Tyrant-Prince, but rather rules Varchaas with his council of Sun-Seers and Fire-Keepers.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of Varchas so far, Taamas?" He asks, and you know better than to mutter anything but meaningless platitudes in response. He nods as though satisfied but you catch him giving you sharp, speculative looks as you wander the Temple. It seems you have aroused his interest.

>	Description	A modest stone building with bas-relief lintels and wide, unshuttered windows. The stylized sun of Mihir flutters from a silk flag above the portico.\r\n\r\nIt is a scene of controlled chaos. You can see the white-cloaked Guards bustling to and fro within, shouting companionably to each other while a stream of Fungus-Carters, merchants and ordinary citizens petition them.

>>>	Description	"We are preparing for the pilgrimage to Amaradri - the Mountain of Light," a young Guard tells you, stamping yet another merchant's application. "It always turns into a bit of a festival. Everyone wants permission to go, and so they come to harangue us when the Sun-Priests turn them away."\r\n\r\nIs it a religious pilgrimage? "Well, a bit," she makes a face. "Every merchant in the city suddenly becomes very devoted to Mihir when pilgrimage season comes, anyway!" [When you have completed certain stories in the City, the Pilgrimage will begin, opening new opportunities.]

She raises her eyebrows exaggeratedly.\r\n\r\nOne of her companions, clearly a wit, adds, "Guards don't dream in Varchas; the Master-at-Arms confiscates all your sleeping-hours when you sign up."\r\n\r\nThe young Guard shakes her head. "Perhaps you should talk to the priests at the Temple of Mihir. They are well-versed in such matters."

"So far all they do is talk and smoke water-pipe and grumble, but I fear that they have strayed from the light of Mihir."\r\n\r\nShe sighs exaggeratedly. "Still, my superiors think that they are harmless. Perhaps this will change their minds. Mihir look down upon you for telling us, Taamas."

>>>	Description	The Sergeant does not object when you slip into line, but he doesn't treat you with any particular gentleness either. You practice hand-to-hand combat for a few hours, and end up on your back more often than not; they fight in an unfamiliar, light-footed style. A few of the more advanced recruits duel with curving, twin-bladed scimitars.\r\n\r\n"Interesting," the Sergeant grunts, at the end of your session. You are bruised and possibly concussed, but quite satisfied with your morning: and you think they may have learnt something in turn.

>>>	Teaser	The rules are complicated and arcane...
>>>	Description	The rules are complicated and arcane. They also seem to alter with the positioning of various pieces on the board. The bone-snakes are trick-pieces, and used to stymie your opponent's moves. As such they are often greeted with hisses of derision when someone dares to put them in play.\r\n\r\nYou manage to acquit yourself reasonably well. At least, you aren't the first one to be knocked out of contention. Your fellow players stand you a cup of tart, ruby-red wine.

>>>	Teaser	"No no no! - 
>>>	Description	"No no no!" The Initiate shakes her fist at the irate Novice. "You cannot undermine a <i>heard</i> text with mantras from a <i>remembered</i> one!"\r\n\r\nApparently the difference is this: 'heard' texts were cosmic truths whispered by Mihir himself to the ancient sages. 'Remembered' texts do not claim such illustrious origins, and are merely passed-down wisdom. \r\n\r\nThe difference might seem trivial to you, but apparently this is a subject of heated theological debate. A few of the other patrons look on indulgently, and offer bits of scripture or shouted exhortation.

>>>	Description	Even an exhibition match requires some skill; you rake across your opponent's arm with your first slash, and the arbitrator calls off the match. Apparently it is very bad manners to draw blood. You hear someone mutter, "bloody Taamas" and "dark-touched", and make a strategic retreat.
>>>	Teaser	The blades are light and deadly; there is an intent light in your opponent's eyes...
>>>	Description	The blades are light and deadly; there is an intent light in your opponent's eyes. You step together and then away, your blades kissing gently before scraping apart in a rasp of steel. Your opponent is going easy on you, but that is what you are here for. An exhibition match is meant to make both parties look good.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to keep your mouth from curving into a sharp grin as your blades clash and chime; you sweat under all the reflected light, and your arms are shaking by the time the arbitrator calls time. Your opponent bows deep, a flick of eyebrows and a flourish of blades, and you do the same.

>>>	Description	The Dour-Faced Nurse ties a mask around your face before leading you into the ward, which is set over two floors. The first thing you notice are the patients' constant, wracking coughs. "We give them syrups and remedies," the Nurse tells you, "but Lung-Bloom is a chronic condition."\r\n\r\nCoughing is the only symptom in the milder cases, but as you walk further in you begin to see hands and feet covered in mold, and then chests budding with little mushroom-cups and lichen and even a young girl with a fringed, red-orange fungal flower blooming in place of an eye.\r\n\r\n"It's the Fungus-Harvester's disease," the Dour-Faced Nurse tells you sadly, pulling you away. "It only gets worse in the heat and light, but what can we do?"
>>	Name	The Fungal Infections Ward

>>>	Description	"That is where we keep the Mirror-Mad," she says with a shudder. "The mirrors...whispered to them. And instead of going to the Sun-Priests, they whispered back."\r\n\r\nAnd you just <i>abandon them</i> in a locked room? "We don't despise them. They are given food and water. Tending the Mirror-Mad uses up almost as much fuel as Mihir's temple, because they can only be lit with direct lamp-light. We don't dare let them near any mirrors." \r\n\r\nShe shudders again. "The Mirror-Mad are worse than Taamas. They no longer serve Mihir but...other powers. Those that speak in dreams and visions." She refuses to say anything else.
>>	Name	The Mirrorless Room

>>>	Description	"Most of these wounds happened outside the city - on hunting expeditions or trade missions," the Dour-Faced Nurse explains severely, raising her voice. "Which is why most of these malingerers are Guards."\r\n\r\nThe patient nearest to her pretends to swoon. "But what would I do, away from your gentle, tender gaze, O Fair Nurse?" He clasps his hands to his bosom. "Surely I would wither and perish?"\r\n\r\n"We'll see who withers when I give you your sponge-bath," she retorts, and her patient draws up his blankets meekly, though his mouth still curves up in a smile.

They try the same thing with the Campaigner, but only very briefly. You see the Campaigner and the Nurse exchange a glance of challenging, cordial respect.\r\n\r\n"Good work," the Dour-Face Nurse says at the end of your shift, handing you each a cup of steaming mushroom-tea.

>	Description	It seems as though half the city has joined the Pilgrimage to the Mountain of Light; the other half lines the streets and hangs out from upper-story windows to watch their friends and loved ones depart. Musicians play stirring tunes on polished brass-instruments and little calabash-lyres, all undercut with the rhythmic sound of drums.\r\n\r\nA towering machine piled high with fungus is wheeled to the front of the procession. The drivers sit in a lamp-lit cabin at the front, their faces grim. The Agnihotri raises his hand, and a hush falls over all of Varchas.\r\n\r\nThe Mirrored Gates slide open, rays of light reflecting jaggedly. Outside, the Elder Continent is dark and hushed and vast. You have the dizzying feeling that it is vaster and onyx-blacker than the Unterzee, somehow, but that cannot be.

The Lamp-Lighters dart to the very edge of the darkness, and light the fungus with their torches. \r\n\r\nIt blazes up, illuminating the path inland in brilliant, white, rot-scented light. The people of Varchas cheer so loudly you think your eardrums will burst. \r\n\r\nThe pilgrims stream slowly out of the city in a glimmering procession, leaving it half-empty behind them.

There are pools of shadow visible in the formerly shadowless city, and Varchaasi huddle together and avoid the dark spaces with fear twisting their faces.\r\n\r\nYou see Varchaasi clashing with white-cloaked Guards in the streets, shouting slogans. They call themselves Neathers, and wear pieces of broken mirror around their necks.\r\n\r\nEven the Temple of Mihir has not escaped their anger. Across the stone threshold the Neathers have arranged thousands of glittering pieces of broken mirror into the words: WE HAVE ALREADY FALLEN.\r\n\r\nThe Pilgrims are still away, and with them the Agnihotri and his council of Sun-Priests. It is the perfect moment for a revolution.\r\n\r\nAnd what will you do?

The Guard at the Mirrored Gates looks a little surprised that you are leaving, but says nothing as she makes the mark in her ledger.\r\n\r\n"Walk in the light of Mihir, Taamas," she calls after you, her voice threaded through with terror. \r\n\r\nYou step into the darkness beyond the edge of the city's illumination as her words echo in your ears. Your ship is moored at the dock, and vast glorious blackness of the Unterzee awaits you.

"Your very presence in Varchas made us think, and wonder, and <i>imagine</i>."\r\n\r\nHe turns to the other Neathers, and holds up the shard of broken mirror hanging around his neck by a thin thread. "We deny the tyranny of Mihir and his Priests and his high-born Fire-Keepers! We refuse to isolate ourselves from the rest of the Neath any longer! We refuse to fear the dark, and cower in the light!" His voice raises to a roar. "WE ARE FALLEN!"\r\n\r\nThe Neathers shout their enthusiasm, and hold up their mirror-shards like banners. "WE ARE FALLEN!" they cry.\r\n\r\nWell, they are certainly enthusiastic. But does that mean they are right?

>>>	Description	The Temple of Mihir is a war-room. "We cannot let Varchas fall into darkness," the oldest Sun-Priest addresses the assembled Guards and citizens. "The Neathers have not simply turned away from Mihir's gaze, but they <i>actively conspire with his enemies</i>." A sussuration goes through the crowd as the Sun-Priest holds up a shard of broken mirror. \r\n\r\n"They are in thrall to the Parabolan powers who whisper through mirrors and entice through dreams and trickery. They are breaking the mirrors and dousing the lamps."\r\n\r\nIf they are <i>breaking</i> mirrors, you point out, how then can they be in league with mirror-lords?\r\n\r\nThe Sun-Priest gives you a pitying look. "Oh, Taamas. What happens when you break a mirror?" He snaps the shard he is holding, and holds the broken pieces in either hand. They glint jaggedly. "You simply <i>make more mirrors</i>."\r\n\r\nPerhaps he is telling the truth. Or perhaps he merely fears the Neathers, and their desire to curtail the power of the Temple to which he is sworn.

The Jewel-Turbaned Youth and the leaders of the Neathers are dragged into the burning light of the temple by a dozen Guards.\r\n\r\nThe Sun-Priests form a ring in the middle of the temple, under the the statue of Mihir's watchful, carnelian-eyed gaze.\r\n\r\nThe Sun-Priests begin to chant, faster and faster, faster and faster until your heart begins to hammer in time to their words. They douse lamp after lamp until they create a perfect circle of darkness bounded by their joined hands.\r\n\r\nOne by one, the Sun Priests throw the revolutionaries into the shadow. The Jewel-Turbaned Youth is the last to be thrown in, and he is weeping piteously.\r\n\r\n"You are Taamas now," the Sun-Priests declare. "You have no name. The darkness has taken it from you. Mihir has turned his gaze away."\r\n\r\nThen they break the circle, relight the lamps and simply turn away.

>>>	Description	Not very hard, as it turns out. The Neathers are grim and committed and have years of pent-up grievances to air. The Jewel-Turbaned Youth leads the Neathers through the city; everywhere they pass mirrors are shattered and lamps are extinguished. Every now and then he pauses and gazes into the mirror-shard dangling from his neck. \r\n\r\nYou help them break the Western Principal Mirror, and other groups of Neathers across the city break the Eastern, Southern, Northern Mirrors. You raise your voice in a cheer as the Eternal Flame in the Temple of Mihir is put out. Your throat is raw. \r\n\r\nDarkness falls in Varchas, City of Broken Mirrors. Screams and hoarse shouts and terrible, withering laughter rise up into the sky, a fearful counterpoint to the jagged celebrations of the Neathers.

We are all Taamas now."\r\n\r\nThere is triumph in his eyes, but also a glinting madness that was not there before. You wonder if the mirrors are whispering to him. You wonder if he has been whispering back.\r\n\r\nYou wonder many things, but it is not your place. You leave Varchas behind you, to piece itself back together again.

You can see other ill-fated Neathers through open-tent flaps. They sit on mouldering cushions and sip mushroom-tea.\r\n\r\n"We decided to leave Varchas, now that we are no longer Varchaasi," he explains. Though they haven't gone particularly far. He gives you an ironic look. "We have not given up our cause, but we are not quite ready for the wide open sea yet." \r\n\r\nHe looks out over the glistening black expanse of the Unterzee, and a smile spreads slowly over his wan features.

Perhaps blemmigans will creep into the city where they cannot. Perhaps blemmigans will be the ones to extinguish the light of Mihir.

>>>	Description	One of the Mute Exiles brings him a loaf of brown algae-bread. Another gives him a chipped jug of water. The Navigator does not thank you or say goodbye. From the moment he sets foot on the isle, he does not speak at all. But he takes your hand in his, briefly, before turning to the Exiles' cave.\r\n\r\nAs you leave, one of the Exiles tugs at your sleeve. He leads you to an unmarked stone the size of a church Bible, produces a chisel and hammer from his robe, and strikes the stone three times. It splits in half.

Ice crusts over the crack between its valves. Approach, and your breath freezes, falls tinkling in shards from the air. It would be utterly foolish to touch the thing.\r\n\r\nA merciless wind blows from everywhere to everywhere. It passes without effort through your bridge-coat, your flesh, your lungs.

They are a library of villains and villainy: here are murders, betrayals, treasons and perjuries. He stops, stares at one, pulls it free. "This is mine," he says. "I wrote this." It is a confession. Beneath, in more recent and less careful letters, he has added a note: <i>You did not answer. If I cannot be forgiven, then I will forget. The Chapel of Lights will help me, for a price.</i>\r\n\r\nHe laughs, wildly. "Twice! I paid them twice! Once to take my memories, and once to guide me back to them!"

>>>	Description	"She was a smuggler of our honey, this zee-captain: and also a gambler, and a frequent visitor to the Tongue. Her debts became so onerous that I had to take her in keeping. Her family paid the ransom to redeem her, but - oh dear, let me be honest with you - I was a little short of operating funds that month. So I sold her to Zaira, for the Garden of Cages." They smile.

>>>	Description	That fat spider with the overdeveloped fangs - it was sucking merrily on Seaman Carrilo's bicep before you smashed it. They eat whatever flesh they can find (poor Carrilo, still moaning from the poison's ravages!). But again and again they leap for the eyes. Do they prefer the taste? Is it a tactic?

>>>	Description	He heads up the plank before you. He continues talking, expecting you to keep up. "The Khaganians didn't seem to like me asking questions. Not many people do. It's made me unpopular in most ports. But there's still one I haven't tried. Could you take me to Hideaway? It's beneath the waves, on the back of a gigantic beast. You cannot miss it."

>>>	Description	He doesn't say much as you model, only mumbling, "Could you look a little more - no, just a little - yes, hold that." Once his break ends, he passes you the book. He's captured you well, right down to your smallest blemish. \r\n\r\nIt's not the only time he's sketched you, either. There are recollections of how you appeared on the dock, scenes of you captaining your vessel, and memories of your work together in crafting the bitter flavour. The anguish he spent over the detail is apparent.

>>>	Teaser	The stories all centre on cafés and anarchists...
>>>	Description	The stories all centre on cafés and anarchists. Most are placed on the surface, though some happen in London. One story, about the formulation of a plan that exploded a city block, featured a relentless coffee motif. "It's an attack on art," the Apprentice jokes, sheepishly. One story revolves around a failed plot in London; another focuses on the desperate escape afterward, made possible by a mysterious patron. The whole collection of work, while stilted, is violently aligned to the anarchic cause, and remarkably detailed.

>>>	Teaser	Your music echoes through the normally silent city...
>>>	Description	Your music echoes through the normally silent city. Its rhythm disrupts the harmony of the festival dancers - they stumble, and stop. The Master of the Dance tries to rally the revellers against you. He doesn't even remove the ribbon from his mouth as he approaches. But no one else joins him. Those who haven't abandoned the dance hall just stand watching the ribbon unspool. 
>>	Name	Provide the Investigator with an full orchestra

>>>	Teaser	The Visionary's maps of the city are pinned to the wall behind him...
>>>	Description	The Visionary's maps of the city are pinned to the wall behind him. Instead of planning the city's electrical grid, they now present lines of battle. The Visionary, wearing the tattered patch of a white-and-gold fish over his heart, details his plan of attack to you and your brigade.\r\n\r\nYour group surrounds the Investigator's band, then attacks. The skins of makeshift-drums are kicked in. A violin is shattered against a wall. A trumpeter flee with their rusty instrument, but are cornered in an alley. Once the scuffle is over, the Silent Reel continues in perfect quiet. The Investigator is stopped, at least for tonight.
>>	Name	Silence the Investigator's intrusive band
>>	Description	The Sprightly Visionary has collected a group of people willing to act against the Investigator. Join them.

>>>	Description	Perhaps you cannot get past the guards to see the Suggester personally. But you can shout.\r\n\r\nAs the festival commences, the Suggester looks dully into the crowd. The Suggester scarcely draws breath. And when they sign the topic of today's reflection  - "broken city-shells" - an unprecedented murmur breaks out among the dwellers. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, the people still gather materials and begin work - they have become accustomed to focusing their thoughts through artistry. Some handle the sharp spines carelessly, catching their skin. A few craft Temtum without his city-shell, and douse him with tears. When the time comes for them to describe their pieces, most merely chuck their offering down the pit without ceremony.
>>>	Name	Pained creation
>>	Name	Join the Investigator and entreat the Suggester
>>	Description	The Suggestion is used to make the people of Hideaway consider only their gratitude towards Temtum. The Suggester mustn't be weak-hearted; they must be honest, for the good of all they love.
>>>	Teaser	First the Investigator's followers come disguised as friends of the Suggester...
>>>	Description	First the Investigator's followers come disguised as friends of the Suggester. Stern - but still polite - gestures are enough to deter them. When the Investigator's compatriots later return in force, more physical means are required; they're sent away bloodied.\r\n\r\nThe festival proceeds like all others before it. The Suggestion is that the people should reflect on Temtum's friendship. The offerings are intensely thoughtful, and the explanation of the offerings are unusually long. The Slow-Blinking Vendor performs the sign of togetherness over and over again, until she's shaking with tears and must be led away.
>>	Name	Join the Sprightly Visionary's guard
>>	Description	Let the people have their festival. They've never needed to reflect on the positives more. 
>>>	Teaser	You lead the Impolite Investigator's followers to a building behind an iron gate...
>>>	Description	You lead the Impolite Investigator's followers to a building behind an iron gate. Though your force is not strong enough to break past the contingents set up by the Visionary, it is sizeable enough to distract them. As they fight, you clamber over the gate, and climb up the cracks in the building to enter through an open window. Inside the Sprightly Visionary consults a map on his wall, leaving unattended a brass panel of switches and gauges. You smash it with a wrench, and leap back out the window.\r\n\r\nBut when you land, there is rumbling - screaming from the festival square. Everyone runs to the violence. Even the Visionary leaves his centre, and dashes to the scene.
>>	Name	Break the Sprightly Visionary's illusion
>>	Description	The Investigator is organising an assault on the Sprightly Visionary stronghold. The Visionary has created a display of coloured lights for the Rainbowing. They will be well defended, but there may be another way...
>>>	Teaser	Though weapons are banned throughout Hideaway, the teeth and spines you provide ensure the battle is bloody...
>>>	Description	Though weapons are banned throughout Hideaway, the teeth and spines you provide ensure the battle is bloody. After being sent away from the alternator, the remnants of the Investigator's group converge on a building behind an iron gate. Their bodies are bruised, and they are bleeding. It is easy to repel them, and many of the Visionary's forces enjoy the sport of beating the fellow dwellers. It is also a distraction: the Investigator is attempting to scale the building. You pull him away from the window - he only stares at you, as the lights begin to cycle through their colours like a kaleidoscope. But then there is rumbling - screaming from the festival square. Everyone runs to the violence. Even the Visionary leaves his centre, and waves you to follow him.

>>>	Description	The engineers of the Canal took advantage of existing caves and passages where they could. In ancient times, this was a passage to the Underworld, they say. But still, the labour must have been staggering. The story goes that the Masters of the Bazaar lent their arts and allies to the task, but the Surface nations play down the fact. Certainly, some of the tunnels look blasted or tunneled, others look... dissolved? "Stone pigs," a stoker whispers. "Stone pigs."
>>>	Name	The coils of the Earth

>>>	Description	This would be a prime spot for a pub or wine-shop, but the interests of the Echo Bazaar, and the laws of London, prevent it. They don't like competition. Still, there are temporary half-legal hostelries in long-moored ships. Here you trade stories with suntanned Surface sailors - stories of Paris and Batavia, the Lost Fires and the Final Isles...

>>>	Description	The Travel-Writer sets swiftly into the port, his briefcase hanging easily at his side. \r\n\r\nIn the middle of your afternoon tea, a crowd rushes by the café. They gather at the foot of a lamppost, gawking, shrieking, gasping. A woman is strung from the light, her face sliced like Venetian blinds. "Heavens," a pale navigator whispers. "Isn't she the explorer? Said she meant to plant a flag on the zee-bed?" No one replies. You spy the Travel-Writer in the crowd, frowning.

You prop the ladder to the porthole of what the Gallivant assures you is the cabin of a French diplomat. He ascends swiftly, leaving you to carry the ladder away.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, the Gallivant is back on your deck. He polishes his ruby cuffs. "I have seen the face of eternity printed in ink.

You entice the Surface sailor on board with promises of zee-stories and Neath delicacies, and bludgeon them over the head between courses. They fall gently into a bowl of sea-lily soup.

It gleams with its own light.\r\n\r\nThe zailor curses you for saving his life. "Now there's nothing but zailing in the dark," he says. "And I'll likely drown instead of burn. But for now you'd better have me on your crew, since you're the reason I still need a job and rations."

Your gaze follows it.\r\n\r\nWhen your gaze returns to the ship, you realise that the ship is elsewhere. Gasps from your crew tell you you're not imagining it.

Two stone knives rest on its surface, along with a chunk of flint that might be a knife, a tool or simply a lump of rock.\r\n\r\nThree human skulls wait in a niche at the back. Two have warped and lengthened jaws: the third has slumped and run like a melted candle, although it feels as solid as any bone to the touch.\r\n\r\nWhat now? You can press on, but the going will get harder from here. Or you could turn back with your treasures.
>>	Name	Search the Church of the Starved Men

"Shtill, the change remainsh. The change remainsh!"\r\n\r\nIt's the longest speech you've ever heard from it. It remains motionless in prayer while you search. An inscription on the altar reads SO ARE WEE SHAPEDE. The stonecraft is perfect, but the spelling seems eccentric. Two stone knives rest on its surface, along with a chunk of flint that might be a knife, a tool or simply a lump of rock.\r\n\r\nThree human skulls wait in a niche at the back.

>>>	Description	Perhaps, once, the gate was finely counter-balanced. Perhaps, once, hidden machineries would have roared at the touch of the Eolith, and the gate would have swung open like oiled glass. Now, the Eolith only triggers the unlocking mechanism. It takes three sailors with crowbars to move the rubble and force the door open - down-open, so that when you bring it free, it collapses inwards with an echoing crash. Climb through the gap, into a space that roars with wind -
>>>	Name	Making an entrance
>>	Name	The Gate of Forms
>>	Description	Here - in the floor, because of the stalactite's fall - is a gate of glittering chalcedony, half-lost beneath rubble but thick enough to resist the most determined assault. Its surface is a relief of twisted limbs, distorted faces screaming in glee. (Carved? Moulded? Impossibly, natural?) A pit at its centre might be a key-socket, or only a mouth.

>>>	Description	A dozen corpses, decades-dry lie at the stalagmite's root. You think there was a barricade here, but the fall has smashed it and the remnants have fallen into the sea. Were they defending the root? Gunner Atkins squints at the scorched and shattered rock, and nods wisely. "Gunpowder," he opines. "Blew it up themselves. Killed the whole city. Starved Men, eh? Allus heard they fight each other. Mad as toads."\r\n\r\nIn the immemorial tradition of subterranean adventurers, you search the corpses. Well, it's not like they've been <i>buried</i>. Their bones of their limbs and faces are blurred and twisted, like melted wax... You find trinkets, disgusting remnant-chunks, and oh good God! Yes. Yes, that's worth a bit. Worth a lot. Best not let your men see it.\r\n\r\nNothing else remains here. Signal your ship with flares, and she'll approach: you can scramble down and drop into the zee, to be retrieved. Much safer than the tunnels of Godfall.
>>	Name	The Root-Gallery
>>	Description	You've traversed half the length of the stalactite called Godfall, from the monastery to here. The Starved Men cut a tremendous gallery around the whole root of the stalactite, leaving a vast central pillar to support its weight. In its day, the view must have been unrivalled. Remnants of salvaged glass and wooden eating-houses, viewing-booths, sight-temples still cling to the edges - but the root has been shattered, and the stalactite fell.\r\n\r\nGo a little closer - clamber carefully across the tilted surface of the gallery floor towards the shattered stump of the root.

Perhaps something occurs to you.\r\n\r\nNothing else remains here. Signal your ship with flares, and she'll approach: you can scramble down and drop into the zee, to be retrieved.

>>>	Description	They're tenacious, these leather remnants, but not strong. Some force has distorted remants of women and men into ragged, furious mannequins.

>>>	Name	Painstaking progress

>>>	Teaser	It's the air...

With a single scream he topples sideways into the grasping goo! His mates try to tug him free, but the stuff has an iron grip. The screaming goes on and on, until he sinks deep enough - the amber pushes its careless fist into his mouth, and finally he's silenced. Move on. Move on.
>>>	Name	A fall!
>>>	Teaser	You each step cautiously from chair to table to bench...
>>>	Description	You each step cautiously from chair to table to bench. Thankfully, the amber's grasp keeps the furniture from swaying too much. As you reach the far side, a careless crewman stumbles and the chair swings sideways with a clotted 'splorch' sound - but you've made it across.
>>>	Name	A safe crossing
>>	Name	Lost in amber
>>	Description	A spherical room. The ceiling drips honey; the walls and floor are glazed with warm orange-yellow. It's gives under your touch - slowly, but when you try to pull your hand free, it takes all your strength. Tables and chairs project through the yard-thick amber on the floor - enough to cross, perhaps.
>>>	Teaser	Dazzled, you trip...
>>>	Description	Dazzled, you trip. A knife-length projection of crystal parts your pea-coat as if it were crepe paper. You lurch to the exit: your crew helps you bandage it as best they may. "Nasty cut," the bo'sun helpfully observes. "A little to the left and it'd bleed you like a Christmas pig."

>	Description	"No more light," the Obsequious Steward cautions you. "The Curator is terribly afraid of moths." He opens the door, and you step into near-darkness. A pair of luminous lamp-lighter bees buzz in a latticed ivory tube. There is no other source of light.\r\n\r\nA bandaged shape no larger than a child lies crumpled on a couch. It lifts its head with obvious effort. It takes several seconds for you to distinguish its voice from the soft buzz of the bees.

As the door opens, it shrinks from the finger of light that reaches across the floor.\r\n\r\nOutside, the Obsequious Steward nods. "The book? Yes, the book." He hands you a slim, illustrated volume.

A recess, approximately the size of the cinder, waits.\r\n\r\nYou place the cinder there and close the lid. Faint atonal music, like the pricking of starlight, drifts from within. "I will never see Parabola," the Curator wheezes. "But perhaps you will. Take this mirror. It was born in a volcano..." Dark glass, serpent-carved.

For a moment you forget what you were doing.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," the Curator whispers. "Perhaps you have saved me from the Sanatorium. And perhaps - the emergence - will be less painful -" Its chest pulses feebly. \r\n\r\nYou accept a single huge black pearl. The Curator's fancies grow worse, but it pays well.

But perhaps I will see - within - " It raises the hand with the Hunter's Eye towards its concealed face.\r\n\r\nNo sound is indescribable, but some should be. This is one. Let us not trouble ourselves with its nuances - its reminders of marsh and gangrene and chrysalid emergence.\r\n\r\n"Take," it says. Its voice is ragged. It gestures at a side-table where a spoire-tusk sits. A pearl tiara is perched jauntily atop the tusk. Both, apparently, are yours.

And then, perhaps, the Moth." \r\n\r\nIt's plainly rambling, but at least it hasn't forgotten your reward - a cameo of a bandaged beauty painted on the mummified palm of a mummified hand. All right, not to everyone's taste, but it's terribly well executed.

As with many languages spoken in dreams, you understand the meaning without understanding the words: a great disaster has been averted, the King's folly is ended by the Princess' cunning, the heralds of night are bound. Yes, the sun is gone, and no, the places below ground are not what had been taught, but perhaps that's for the best, considering. It will be remembered. They will mark their triumph. You wake.

>>>	Teaser	Where did it learn to cook?
>>>	Description	Where did it learn to cook? Not in its amber-smeared home-tunnels, because it obviously prefers its food raw. Between gulps and flabbers, it attempts to chat.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to decipher its words. Its mouth is full of fish-flesh; its mind is alien; and besides, it's terribly shy. Consequently, the evening is not a great success.\r\n\r\nBut you learn a little of its past. It was abandoned in Port Cecil for Rubbery crimes - crimes whose nature quite slip the surly bonds of language. The Principles found it an apt tool, and has been its patron ever since.

It speaks of its plans to visit Flute Street below London, where its relatives dwell: to bring them gifts of knowledge which will erase its crimes.\r\n\r\nIt tells you stories of travel through the void on the vast-shelled black back of a messenger thing. It shares jokes from its spawn-world, Axile. None of the jokes make any sense, but they linger on the surfaces of your thought like graffiti scrawled in a language you knew when you were very young...

>>>	Teaser	Ruins of a previous civilisation underlie Venderbight...
>>>	Description	Ruins of a previous civilisation underlie Venderbight. Tomb-colonists have unearthed the secrets of the Third City.

But they're very happy to share the information that the Khaganians shared in turn...

>	Teaser	Silvery light fills a sea-cave, dripping from the walls...
>	Description	Silvery light fills a sea-cave, dripping from the walls. It condenses to pools of whitish fluid on the uneven floor. Sea-sound fills the cave, strong and slow, like the long beating of a heart. On a square slab of coral, someone has set up a game of chess. The pieces are different from the ones used in London. You see the spiralling Bishops, the corner Roots, the Kin and the terrible Cream. As you touch each one, a deep voice whispers its name...

>>>	Description	A Rubbery Man rises from a cyst in the floor. An iridescent cicatrice crosses its face. Even in this flood of silvery light, it pulses like a fevered moon. It shuffles closer.\r\n\r\n"Shalt-Flions," it wheezes. Unprecedented! A Rubbery capable of human speech (in however debased and pitiful a mode!)\r\n\r\n"My emissary," the cave whispers. "Treat it gently." The whisper follows you back up the steps. "Take it to the Salt-Lions..."
>>>	Name	An assistant
>>	Name	Offer assistance with dissolution

And then you'll need to defeat me.\r\n\r\nBring me a Wakeful Idol, to be my new Bishop.\r\n\r\nBring me a monster's tooth, to be my new Night.\r\n\r\nBring me a heart-shelled silver, to be my new Root.\r\n\r\nBring me a little flint, to be my new Paw.\r\n\r\nAnd bring me a Fluke-Core. For my Kin."\r\n\r\nAt each phrase, the Outcast nods and sways, nods and sways. Somehow, it looks frightened.
>>	Name	Setting up
>>	Description	The Outcast toddles eagerly over to the chess-board, to place the sphinxstone piece at one corner. "Oh yes," the voice of the Principles sighs."Oh yes, that will very good. But I ache so to be reduced, to be less. Will you bring more? I will pay most in scintillack, and in secrets."
>>>	Teaser	"Here your scintillack...
>>>	Description	"Here your scintillack. Another secret? I have so few remaining. Will you despoil me further? You will? No, I am tired. No secret for you today. If you press me, I will sulk. I am old. I want to be less than I am. I want to be only coral. Call that a secret, if you must."
>>	Name	Give the Principles a Wakeful Idol

>>>	Description	"Kneel, kneel, and my Emissary will gift you Scintillack. The secret. The Bazaar brought me; brought us all, all us shapelings, Axiles. The Flukes, the misers, even my Emissary. Why? Too deep a secret for me, my friend. Even here, too deep for me. Perhaps when you end me..."

>>>	Description	The Emissary, trembling, takes his place across the board from you. "He will dissolve with me," the Principles tells you, consolingly. "It's for the best. You must win the game. Defeat him, and he and I will end. I will leave treasure. Hurry. My thoughts grow burdensome."
>>	Name	The Last Game
>>	Description	"I will miss chess most when this is done. The black waves, my children's glows, let them pass - but o my sweet diagonal. It's time. Afraid I find. Quickly. The board awaits."
>>>	Teaser	Move and counter-move...
>>>	Description	Move and counter-move. The pieces click and hiss on the board. The victory is easy. The Emissary whimpers and topples his own Kin; he begins to melt like snow in a desert wind.\r\n\r\nScintillack sloughs from the roof, gathers around you in great shining drifts. The voice of the Principles washes over you like the zee, urgently chanting secrets. For every one you hear, another two are lost to the grinding of the rock, or incomprehensible to a mind that has not laired centuries beneath the waves... but you learn, and learn. Your brain is bursting with knowledge.\r\n\r\nNow the voice of the Principles falters, is gone. It subsides into happy mindfulness with a last melodious sigh. The Outcast's face blinks at you from its puddle of goo, and then it too dissolves.\r\n\r\nThe Wakeful Idol which sat on the chess-board now squats by your feet, eyes bright. The Principles had suggested that it would become more, when the Principles became less. It seems a little taller, somehow.
>>	Name	Win the match
>>	Description	The Principles will be reduced, as it desires, to a mindless hump of coral. The Outcast stands trembling behind the board, ready to enact the Principles' moves: its mind will be destroyed with its master's.

>>>	Description	You make a foolish move. Another. Hope dawns in the Outcast's moistly shining eyes. The Principles rumbles as it guesses your intent. The Outcast twitches with delight. It moves its Night. Your Kin is imperilled.\r\n\r\n"Now I regret," the Principles sighs. "Now at last I regret. I regret trusting you, stranger. And you, my Emissary, who was almost me -"\r\n\r\nThe Emissary makes its final move. You topple your Kin. The cave around you is silent. The Outcast straightens, taller than you have ever seen him: it extends a slippery appendage to shake your hand. Together, you climb the steps back to Port Cecil. The Principles never speaks to you again.
>>>	Name	Infinite regret
>>	Name	Lose the match
>>	Description	You are enmeshed in an alien scheme. Perhaps you mistrust it. Perhaps you pity the Outcast. Whatever your motives, you will throw the match on purpose, leaving the Principles trapped in consciousness, defeating the purpose of this whole quest.

Having the Captain on board gives a bonus to skill checks)\r\n\r\nReturn one last time to Saviour's Rocks for the Festival of Silk and the quest reward.\r\n\r\nAlternate path - burn the tree at the Web of Stone. This changes the Nativity and makes the Scuttering Reaches far more dangerous.

But you've paid the duty which I think is eccentric of you but to each their own and you are an individual of honour, are you not. My employer is not short of honour either, so if you take a turn about the burnt-out warehouse at the end there you might find a little pile of crates containing items of interest."

>>>	Description	You are no longer welcome across the webbed bridge. The sorrow-spiders have no more need of you.
>>>	Name	A blockade of silk
>>	Name	Visit the Web of Stone
>>	Description	You know the way. Perhaps the sorrow-spiders have further tasks for a trustworthy zailor.

>>>	Description	As the lights of the Nativity fade and the candles starts to flicker, the darkness of the Reaches becomes unbearable. Empty-handed but alive, you hurry back to the relative warmth and safety of the port.
>>>	Name	Terror without
>>>	Teaser	Venturing into many caves and crannies, you gather enough silk to fill a crate...
>>>	Description	Venturing into many caves and crannies, you gather enough silk to fill a crate. The audible hostility in the air by the end though makes it clear the sorrow-spiders will only overlook so much of this.
>>>	Name	A scrap of success!
>>>	Teaser	Never let it be said the Scuttering Reaches are without treasures...
>>>	Description	Never let it be said the Scuttering Reaches are without treasures. The desiccated body of a careless Widow is tangled in an ancient web, his satchel of fully processed silk still hanging from his shoulder. Recovering it is grisly, but worth it.
>>>	Name	A prize of silk!
>>	Name	Bring light into the darkness
>>>	Teaser	How curious! - 
>>>	Description	How curious! In the depths of a seemingly abandoned cave, the word HUMBLE is scrawled across a wall in letters of finest silk. Next to it, a second web reads RADIANT. And next to that... wait... LOOK UP?\r\n\r\nFortunately, the sorrow-spider that drops down onto your face is just a little too slow. As it messily spreads out under your boot, the terrified little piglet in the corner seems overjoyed that its long nightmare is finally over. Almost as overjoyed as the crew will be to find their rations this evening finally feature some pig.
>>>	Name	A message in a web?
>>	Description	The sorrow-spiders avoid the candlelight, but not out of any sense of fear. Though far from tolerant of outsiders, they care little enough for their abandoned webs to turn a blind eye to at least a little scavenging. Up to a point.
>>>	Teaser	For a few precious minutes, it seems the sorrow-spiders are held at bay by the sad green glow...
>>>	Description	For a few precious minutes, it seems the sorrow-spiders are held at bay by the sad green glow. The second it flickers, that fantasy dies. It was not the dark they were waiting for, merely a signal. Fortunately you are still just... just... close enough to your ship to escape unscathed, save a few haunting memories. Not everyone however is so lucky.

It was not the dark they were waiting for, merely a signal.

>>>	Description	For a few precious minutes, it seems the sorrow-spiders are held at bay by the increasingly sad candlelight. Soon enough though, you find yourself surrounded. As the light flickers, a sea of hatred pours in from all sides to fill the new darkness.
>>>	Name	Anger of the sorrow-spiders
>>	Description	The silence of the Reaches is broken by a low hiss that drills through your bones and teeth. The hate of the sorrow-spiders is the sound of uncountable legs beating a singular war-drum. Nothing good can come of this.
>>>	Teaser	The Reaches are no place to explore without some form of light...
>>>	Description	The Reaches are no place to explore without some form of light. The endless sorrow-spiders surrounding you are less keeping their distance than enjoying the free show.\r\n\r\nIt soon becomes clear; this is a fool's errand. Being no fool, at least not today, you return to port empty-handed and shivering, but at least unscathed.
>>>	Name	Stumbling through the dark
>>>	Teaser	Deep in the darkness by a bridge of webs, a small group of Weavers gather silk from their acrimonious masters' abandoned webs...
>>>	Description	Deep in the darkness by a bridge of webs, a small group of Weavers gather silk from their acrimonious masters' abandoned webs. Their lack of sight hardly seems to affect the silent precision of the work, all done to a rhythm drummed by something only they can hear. When they leave though, they take all of their harvest with them save for a few useless scraps.
>>>	Name	A party of Weavers

>>>	Description	Deep in the darkness by a bridge of webs, a small group of Weavers gather silk from their acrimonious masters' abandoned webs. Their lack of sight hardly seems to affect the silent precision of the work, all done to a rhythm drummed by something only they can hear. Rejected silks are simply left on the ground, their inferiority not visible to regular eyes.
>>>	Name	A party of Weavers
>>	Name	Risk exploring without candles
>>>	Teaser	Stumbling over rock and long abandoned stone, you find yourself twisted in a web that wraps tight around your limbs...
>>>	Description	Stumbling over rock and long abandoned stone, you find yourself twisted in a web that wraps tight around your limbs. Hairy legs brush across your frozen face and skin as the sorrow-spiders investigate their prize; their harvest of the precious soft apples delayed only until the futile thrashing gives way to terrified exhaustion.\r\n\r\nBut instead, you wake to find yourself on the ground, the web cut and your captors nowhere to be seen. Someone has rescued you, but who? Why? And from where comes the sick, lingering fear that you may come to regret this act of anonymous generosity?
>>>	Name	Caught!
>>	Description	In this wasteland, only the false-stars in the roof of the Neath illuminate the webs and ruins the sorrow-spiders call home. You may still stumble upon something though. Or indeed, into something.
>	Teaser	The last remnants of an ancient citadel, now home to the spider-council of Saviour's Rocks...
>	Description	The last remnants of an ancient citadel, now home to the spider-council of Saviour's Rocks. Eyeless Weavers and Widows busy themselves tending to the spiders and their Tree of Seasons, showing neither interest or concern at your presence. You will be Summoned.
>	Name	The Web of Stone
>>>	Teaser	The cultists politely ignore you as you watch them at work; the Weavers in red, tending the webs, the Widows in green, caring for their masters by reducing grisly foodstuffs to paste and feeding the more senior members of the spider-council by hand...
>>>	Description	The cultists politely ignore you as you watch them at work; the Weavers in red, tending the webs, the Widows in green, caring for their masters by reducing grisly foodstuffs to paste and feeding the more senior members of the spider-council by hand.\r\n\r\nIf there is any reason for these assignments, it is impossible to tell. Certainly, there is an assortment of male Widows and female Weavers amongst the cultists' ranks.Perhaps the sorrow-spiders have as much interest in human gender as in spider-gender.
>>>	Name	A family of red and green
>>	Name	Spy on the Weavers and Widows
>>	Description	To spy on the blind is no challenge, but the glares of the sorrow-spiders all around make it clear that while here, you will never not be under observation.
>>>	Teaser	From the eyes of the statue pours a poisonous conclave, a thousand lesser sorrow-spiders perching on every rock, brick and outcropping...
>>>	Description	From the eyes of the statue pours a poisonous conclave, a thousand lesser sorrow-spiders perching on every rock, brick and outcropping. The Emissary of Spiders rises from his meditation at the base, his robe festooned with the most senior members of the council that they might whisper their will in his ear. They speak, of course. Most eloquently, in fact. That does not mean they will lower themselves to speak to you. Not directly.\r\n\r\n"Excellent. Excellent." The Emissary of Spiders bows slightly. "My mephitic masters bid you welcome. I believe we have business to discuss."
>>>	Name	The Tree of Seasons runs black with sorrow
>>	Name	Summoned by the spider-council
>>	Description	It is time. You have been called.
>>>	Teaser	Branches of webs hang in their thousands from the colossal statue of some being as far from an angel as an angel from a man...
>>>	Description	Branches of webs hang in their thousands from the colossal statue of some being as far from an angel as an angel from a man. The spider-council has made its home in the chipped out eyes, surrounded by its lessers and a precious collection of ensnared unfortunates. Hundreds of these captives dangle in silk cocoons, the sane and still-living tended to just enough to serve their full measure of both use and suffering.
>>>	Name	Pride of the sorrow-spiders
>>	Name	Behold the Tree of Seasons
>>	Description	The heart of the spider-council. Few have laid eyes upon it, and most of those have had said eyes ritually removed to birth new sorrow-spiders shortly afterwards.
>>>	Teaser	Wait...
>>>	Description	Wait. Are you making a terrible mistake?
>>>	Name	Time slows to a crystal moment
>>	Name	Burn the Tree of Seasons
>>	Description	The Weavers and Widows have torches to warm them during their work. Now you will use them to put an end to it! D__n the consequences!
>>>	Teaser	There is little to be had...
>>>	Description	There is little to be had. Every time you close your eyes for more than a moment, you feel the hairs of a sorrow-spider on your skin or an exploratory rub of a mandible against your eyes. But time slowly passes even so, and eventually, time is what it is.
>>>	Name	An uneasy rest
>>	Name	Attempt to rest until summoned
>>	Description	Amongst an army of poisonous spiders and deranged cultists? Still not as rough as the flophouses of Spite.
>>>	Teaser	The sorrow-spiders often resort to cannibalism when food is low...
>>>	Description	The sorrow-spiders often resort to cannibalism when food is low. It is on occasion the Weavers and Widows' privilege to share that bounty, that they may be a greater part of the whole. At least the poison has been removed, and the legs are surprisingly effective when pressed into duty as impromptu toothpicks.
>>>	Name	A feast of gods
>>	Name	Hospitality of the sorrow-spiders
>>>	Teaser	This is one of many questions for which an answer can serve no good...
>>>	Description	This is one of many questions for which an answer can serve no good. The meat is not especially tender, but it is at least filling.
>>>	Name	"Where is the horse that pulled our cart?"
>>	Description	A polite Widow indicates her fellow disciples' willingness for you to take a meal with them.
>>>	Teaser	There is no chanting and no singing...
>>>	Description	There is no chanting and no singing. There is just a low-pitched noise from the cultists' throats as a sorrow-spider climbs up the initiate's body. He quivers as it reaches his face, drips of excited poison dripping into his lips. Strong, caring, but above all else, firm fingers peel back his eyelids and hold them wide.\r\n\r\nA scream. A mouth silenced with bundled cloth. An embrace. A note raised high and loud, until the Tree of Seasons itself seems to shake in the cacophony.\r\n\r\nA Widow gently kisses his new brother on the forehead, wrapping a silk blindfold around his hollow eyes.
>>>	Name	An eye for an I, said the spider to the fly
>>	Name	A new initiate
>>	Description	A naked young man lies on a stone platform, his shaking hands squeezed tight by his brothers and sisters to be.
>>>	Teaser	The captives have long since ceased moaning, though some still quiver as sorrow-spiders crawl across their bodies, milking their secrets...
>>>	Description	The captives have long since ceased moaning, though some still quiver as sorrow-spiders crawl across their bodies, milking their secrets. A Venturing Cartographer who travelled too far east. A Lady of Means, from a voyage eighteen years prior. The Captain of the wrecked ship Nocturne. A broken Devil, old enough to have forgotten the smell of brimstone. Their eyes long since harvested to birth the sorrow-spiders' progeny, they hang immobile in darkness, dreaming of oblivion.
>>>	Name	There is no escape but death
>>	Name	Further investigate the Tree of Seasons
>>	Description	The sorrow-spiders have taken many prisoners.

>>>	Teaser	They speak of a chaos brought under control by a spider-council formed from the blinded eye of a great zee-beast...
>>>	Description	They speak of a chaos brought under control by a spider-council formed from the blinded eye of a great zee-beast. They speak of the strained partnership it maintains with those who could so easily be enslaved. They speak of a Tree of Epochs, to be birthed in forbidden light, its branches stretching through the Neath to become the perfect geometry of sorrow.

>>>	Description	They speak of a century of stolen secrets, and an almost as long regretted promise made to a great zee-beast. They speak of its greed for knowledge, for which it willingly blinded another creature with the light of the stars. They speak of secrets, eagerly grasped, reluctantly relinquished. They speak of the curse of curiosity. In hushed tones, they speak of a trap, yet to be baited.

>	Name	Preparing for the Festival of Silk
>>>	Teaser	He taps his blindfold...
>>>	Description	He taps his blindfold. "The honour of serving the acrimonious masters does somewhat leave one at a disadvantage in matters of detail." He smiles. "Blind to light is not, however, deaf to rumour. I wonder, might I prevail upon the good natured individual I have heard contributed so much to our little festival? Splendid. Splendid..."\r\n\r\nHe leans in close. "My benefactors have charged me with seeking... a special sustenance for a special occasion. I am sure an experienced zailor such as yourself sees through the necessary euphemism. Shall we say, unfortunates of little future, such as your tomb-colonists? Were perhaps a select few to find a different destination for the greater good, I can promise more than fair compensation for any subsequent regrets." [You may be able to obtain trusting tomb-colonist tourists at Venderbight, if you've assisted them in the past.]
>>>	Name	"Ah, my good sir. Or is it Madam? Or another salutation perhaps? Pardon my ignorance."
>>	Name	Meet with an Emissary of Spiders
>>	Description	He has witnessed much, yet seen nothing, since the sorrow-spiders he serves harvested his eyes.
>>>	Teaser	The silk traders don't talk much...
>>>	Description	The silk traders don't talk much. In particular, they don't talk of the sorrow-spiders at their feet, over their heads or crawling over them as they sleep. Spiders? We'll not be having that kind of talk about the generous neighbours, they say with haste, in raised voices.
>>>	Name	An off-the-cuff, scripted response
>>	Name	Compile a Port Report
>>	Description	The silk-traders of the Nativity know better than to risk loose chatter. Still, a little contribution to their festival may loosen their tongues.

>>>	Description	"We'll only be needing to stock up on supplies like this 'til after the Festival of Silk," warns the merchant, as his people load your goods onto the ship. "It'll be back to Echoes like regular after that, but still, you come see me and I'll give you a deal that'd turn Mr Veils' cloak white."\r\n\r\nHe pauses for a moment, checking the shadows on instinct. "Course, if anyone asks, I never said that."

>>>	Description	The merchant whistles as he opens the crate and finds a couple of bottles of Morelways 1872, apparently rejected by the crew for being fancy toff-water. "Morelways! You don't know how I've dreamed of this stuff since coming here. That Greyfields piss? A vintage for schoolgirls!"\r\n\r\nHe pops the cork and takes a swig, an unpracticed look of happiness spreading across his face. At his gesture, an extra crate is loaded onto your ship.
>>>	Name	A fine bonus!
>>	Description	The fine silk of Saviour's Rocks is the most coveted in the Neath. There can be no better time to acquire some without the usual traders' markup.
>>>	Teaser	"Just trinkets," confirms the man, holding out the box...
>>>	Description	"Just trinkets," confirms the man, holding out the box. From inside comes a slight cracking sound, a hiss, a scratch that hints at nail on wood.\r\n\r\n"Trinkets," he repeats, not meeting your eyes.
>>>	Name	"Trinkets?"
>>	Name	A delivery of 'Trinkets'
>>>	Teaser	"Just trinkets," confirms the man, holding out the box...
>>>	Description	"Just trinkets," confirms the man, holding out the box. Shaking it, you hear a rattling and see a sudden look of horror on the man's face. He says nothing though, merely backs away as quickly as good manners permit.
>>>	Name	"Trinkets?"
>>	Description	An almost entirely legitimate silk-trader urgently requests your help with a delivery to Fallen London.
>>>	Teaser	The traders of the Nativity have little practice showing appreciation, but at least put in an effort...
>>>	Description	The traders of the Nativity have little practice showing appreciation, but at least put in an effort. In particular, they not entirely accidentally let slip the secret of the 'Accord of Grace' - a hospitality granted visitors by the generous neighbours of whom they will speak no ill.\r\n\r\nThey do however hint that this only applies to travellers arriving through the port. Those unlucky enough to run aground on the Rocks can consider themselves... but no. No. A sorrow-spider might hear something they would of course never say.
>>>	Name	Quiet murmurs of appreciation

>>>	Name	All avert their eyes as he is dragged away
>>	Name	A thief of silk
>>	Description	You see him trying to steal from the festival while pretending to gather new banners to hang.

>>>	Description	The Emissary of Spiders has a pair of strong traders load the unfortunate tomb-colonists onto a rickety, already well-stocked supply cart. It would be preferable not to be around when they wake up, but that seems unlikely. The Emissary bids you join him on the cart, now so burdened that the only place to sit is on the coffins.\r\n\r\n"A reward was promised, was it not?" he says, settling himself down on a silk cushion. "Come! The esurient masters demand an audience."

I see she was... never mind. Is this my cabin? Yes. It is more than I deserve." [Appoint your new Officer by dragging him from the Officers tab to his slot at the top of the screen. Do this in port, not at sea, or you may unsettle your crew.]

>>>	Description	The blemmigan whirls across the quay and under a silk-merchant's stall, occasioning some alarm. Gone from your life! Your duty is done!\r\n\r\nNot quite. With a furious insectile screech, sorrow-spiders converge on the stall. The blemmigan is driven into the open! It smashes one spider-carapace with its beak, vaults another spider in a flash of fungal dexterity, fences tendril-to-chelicerae with a third as they both dash up a wall. Then it's gone into the webs, its hyphal slimes protecting him from their sticky adhesions. Spiders pour after it. Who will know its end? Not you. You had nothing to do with this. If anyone asks, you were probably never even here.
>>>	Name	An unseemly brawl

>>	Description	It's almost as if there are no spiders at all!
>>>	Teaser	A crowd has gathered around a lithe dancer clothed in veils...
>>>	Description	A crowd has gathered around a lithe dancer clothed in veils. They flutter into the audience one by one, caught and clutched and their perfume drunk deep by the rowdy audience. The hollering soon changes though as, still clothed in little but scandal, she disappears behind a conveniently placed bit of painted scenery and an obese dockworker emerges to finish the job. \r\n\r\nNobody feels a desire to sniff his silks. Though he does still gets his share of cat-calls.

>>>	Description	There is a huge pile of it placed in the tallest ship in the Nativity's frozen flotilla, atop which a well-nailed plank now stretches for those that dare walk it. Spurred by the mocking challenges of the traders, you find yourself facing a drop a good deal higher than it looked from the ground. But there's no backing out now. The silks open up to greet you; cool, soft, embracing.
>>>	Name	A dive into silks
>>	Description	As the mushroom wine flows, the atmosphere becomes increasingly like home.
>>>	Teaser	The Nocturne?
>>>	Description	The Nocturne? The Lorn-Fluke? Of such things, he will not speak. But his masters appear quite content with how things have resolved, even volunteering a prize secret from their own collection as payment.\r\n\r\n"Curiosity can be such a curse, can it not?" says the Emissary of Spiders. "If you are to be absorbed by an enigma I would heartily recommend it be this. A far safer one than any other you shall find here, to be sure."\r\n\r\nHe bows. And, stroking the sorrow-spider on his shoulder, he returns to his masters, where a tortured Lorn-Fluke already screams for the sake of a secret that never was and another the spiders will never tell.
>>>	Name	"A gift, from the pestiferous masters."

With a furious insectile screech, sorrow-spiders converge on the boat. The blemmigan is driven into the open! It smashes one spider-carapace with its beak, vaults another spider in a flash of fungal dexterity, fences tendril-to-chelicerae with a third as they both dash up a wall. Then it's gone into the webs, its hyphal slimes protecting him from their sticky adhesions. Spiders pour after it. Who will know its end? Not you. You had nothing to do with this.

>>>	Description	The Emissary of Spiders carefully undoes his blindfold, revealing two hollow, scabbed eyes. Unbidden, the sorrow-spider on his shoulder crawls across his face, stabbing one leg into each with a squelch. Just for a moment, the Emissary's face flickers with the euphoria of a new disciple of prisoner's honey, but only for as long as it takes to shiver. His normal, polite countenance returns as the cart rolls onto the webbed bridge, taking you high above the black zee.

>>>	Description	The clicking of sorrow-spiders is nigh-intolerable by the time the cart pulls up by the Web of Stone. The Emissary of Spiders pauses for a moment to carefully detach the juvenile and replaces his blindfold. Absently, he touches and tastes a drop of lingering blood, savouring the sting of poison.\r\n\r\n"You will be summoned when the irascible masters are ready. Until then, please, do enjoy our hospitality." He pauses, turns, licking his finger clean. "I do however urge you to to mind your manners in this place.

He speaks of following the perfect geometry of a spider's web to its natural conclusion, and of the day his mind was ensnared by one as effortlessly as it might have caught a fly.\r\n\r\nThe way he tells it, it almost makes sense. Except of course, for the part about allowing sorrow-spiders to harvest his eyes to make more of their kin.

>>>	Description	A few survivors stumble around, slaves of the sorrow-spiders. The 'generous neighbours' now feast on the corpses of those who fought back against their invasion, weaving webs to completely absorb the Nativity into the Scuttering Reaches. By the docks, the Emissary of Spiders' crucified body hangs from webbing in a clear statement to all that the Accord of Grace that once protected travellers has ended. The sorrow-spiders have no more use for human inefficiencies.

>>>	Description	Tearing a torch from the wall, you throw it deep into the Tree of Seasons. The ancient webs catch fire instantly, spreading quickly as the screams of the captives join those of the Weavers and Widows and the burning spider-council in a cacophony of pain and anger and fury and gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe sorrow-spiders surge as one, tearing your flesh into ribbons as you flail helplessly towards the cliffside in a cloak of legs and fangs. The black zee embraces you, salting the wounds until unconsciousness beckons. If you're lucky, you'll be fished out by a friendly face. For now, there is only the memory of a nightmare not yet escaped.

The ancient webs catch fire instantly, spreading quickly as the screams of the captives join those of the Weavers and Widows and the burning spider-council in a cacophony of pain and anger and fury and gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe sorrow-spiders surge as one, but while this is their domain, the zee is yours and it is only one crazed dive from the walls away. The rush of air explodes into an ice-cold blackness as the water tries to pull you down, but you fight it; fight the cuts and the bites and the poison surging through your system as you swim for your life. Finally, the shadows are still enough to risk dragging yourself ashore. As you collapse, you see the ship... not far, not far... close enough for the crew to send rescue... barely a heartbeat before all goes black.

After all, what use have the masters of Saviour's Rocks for trinkets, baubles, gold and gems?\r\n\r\nIf the crew and passengers were lucky, they merely became lunch. If not... you've heard the stories; the kind of zee ztories saved for campfires on distant shores and cold nights when the rigging creaks. Of the Tree of Ages, a harbinger of doom crewed by sorrow-spiders. What happened to the lovers who found Storm's broken heart in a sandalwood box.

"Pardon the secrecy, but I fear discretion must be at the heart of our endeavour. Suffice it to say, there is a matter of the gravest importance tied to that ship and you shall, if you are deserving of this commission, most assuredly know it when you see it.

One of the courtesans drops the man she was strangling with her silk scarf, and calls for honey-mead for those left standing.\r\n\r\nThe Melliferous Nun - who is entirely unscathed, of course - catches your eye from across the room, and gives you a nod. She takes the caged bee and slips back to Isery's laboratory. A job well done.

>	Description	The Melliferous Sisters make their home in the richly-appointed stone tower of Cavendish Abbey. Their thick gloves and crimson-mesh helmets are worn, less for modesty, and more for practicality. They tend the hives of the lamplighter bees all across the Isle, and make a religious observance of harvesting red honey for the Pirate-King. [Your actions will attract the Pirate-King's notice. You need 5 x Pirate-King's Notice to gain an offer from a Patron.]
>	Name	Cavendish Abbey
>>>	Teaser	She is only a recent novice, and barely even inducted into the Lower Apistic Mysteries...
>>>	Description	She is only a recent novice, and barely even inducted into the Lower Apistic Mysteries. Still, she has some useful information to impart: the recent destabilisation of the red honey trade elsewhere has been fortuitous for the Isle of Cats. Honey production can barely meet demand. The Abbess and the Lady of the Gardens are having some kind of dispute over <i>staffing</i>, of all things. 
>>	Name	Gossip with a Novice
>>	Description	She could, she tells you earnestly, really <i>use</i> a lamentable relic. Best not to ask her what for.

>>>	Description	The Sister tells you that the Pirate-King went to Abbey Rock fifty years ago and asked the Abbess to send some of her novices to Port Cavendish. You ask why, and she shakes her head. "The better question is: why did the Abbess send her precious novices to a place like this?"\r\n\r\nYou suggest a hefty bribe, or perhaps coercion. The Sister cackles harshly. "The Sisters of the Rock respect strength-of-arms, which of course the Pirate-King knew only too well. He challenged the Abbess to a duel, and won. She didn't have much choice then!" She cackles again. "Ask our Abbess if you don't believe me. She was one of those very novices, sent across the zee!"
>>	Name	Fuel for the Bee-Smokers

>>>	Teaser	You recite your news to the Abbess, your voice stuttering every now and then in the cool silence of her office...
>>>	Description	You recite your news to the Abbess, your voice stuttering every now and then in the cool silence of her office. Her face is entirely obscured by her thick veil, and it is impossible to read her reactions. Nonetheless, you must have pleased her - she orders one of her novices to load your ship with casks of mushroom wine.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey overlooks the Rose Garden, and so you make a point to linger at the windows. The roses bloom lush and wanton, each petal the colour of sunset. A tall woman in a golden veil picks her way between the thorned bushes.

>	Description	The alehouse's sign is a tiger painted the colour of rose-petals. Someone has gone to great trouble and expense to gild the creature's eyes; they look out over the port, feral and unseeing.\r\n\r\nA caged hive of lamplighter bees hangs from the ceiling like a chandelier. A few zailors give you hard-mouthed, assessing looks but most ignore your presence entirely.

>>>	Description	The Barkeep stops you before you reach the door, and hands you a brooch set with two amber stones. He waits impassively until you pin it to your clothes. "Everybody wears the cat's eyes here," he tells you, moving aside to let you pass. "Just a friendly reminder that the Pirate-King is watching." It seems that no place, then, is truly lawless.
>>>	Name	Laws of the land
>>	Name	Leave the alehouse
>>	Description	There must be more to the Isle of Cats than drunken sots and zee-stories. [Make sure you have learned all you wish to before you leave this place.]
>>>	Teaser	"Cat's eyes," one of them says...
>>>	Description	"Cat's eyes," one of them says. "For the Pirate-King." As far as you can gather, the Pirate-King's name is Leopold, and he controls all the trade on the island. Half of the Catties believe that he can take the form of a crimson tiger, and creep into their dreams.\r\n\r\nThe other half suspect, more prosaically, that he simply eats those who displease him. 
>>	Name	Significant tokens
>>	Description	The Catties all wear a pair of amber stones threaded around their necks, or pinned to their collars.

>>>	Description	You turn your head as though you are admiring one of the mouldering draperies hung from the wall. A vial flashes in the buyer's trembling hands. He uncorks it, pours a few drops of thick red liquid down his throat. The vial drops to the floor. When you look back up, he is gone.\r\n\r\nYou blink, and look around. Nobody else seems in the least perturbed that a man - disappeared? - from their midst. You pick up the fallen vial and examine the traces left inside: sticky honey gleaming with redness entirely unlike blood. 
>>>	Name	The merest taste

>>>	Description	"A Melliferous Sister, of course," she responds, performing a complicated negotiation between veil, thick glove and glass of mushroom-wine. You ask what one of those is, and she snorts. "I'm glaring at you underneath this bloomin' veil."\r\n\r\nYou act appropriately cowed, and the Melliferous Sister thaws a little. "We are Bee-Keepers and Honey-Harvesters. The Catties owe their prosperity to us, and the Pirate-King too." She slurps the last of the mushroom-wine behind her veil, and the Barkeep glides over to refill her glass, eyes respectfully downcast. 
>>	Name	Religious observances

>	Teaser	The King's Claw tells you to call them Isery...
>	Description	The King's Claw tells you to call them Isery. They are dressed in azure silk, and wearing clawed rings of enamelled metal and ivory on the fingers of their right hand. They are very beautiful, if you like them sharp and glittering and ambiguously gendered.\r\n\r\n"You have caught the interest of the Pirate-King, and therefore <i>my</i> interest as well," they say, fixing you with an amber-eyed gaze. "You seem capable enough. And I have need of a capable... friend."

>>	Name	Refuse Isery
>>	Description	Perhaps you are unsettled by Isery's beauty, or perhaps by the prospect of working for one so comfortable with the Catties' Pirate-King.

>>	Description	One of the courtesans of the Honeyed Tongue bends down to whisper in Isery's ear, and they give you a thoughtful look.
>>>	Teaser	Isery's eyebrows lift infinitesimally, but their reply is measured...
>>>	Description	Isery's eyebrows lift infinitesimally, but their reply is measured. "When lamplighter bees suck the nectar of this crimson strain of exile's rose, they are driven to madness. They enter the brains of humans and harvest their memories." They make a small gesture, as though to elide the exact process. "Those memories are instilled in red honey. Each sip a burst of memory on the tongue."\r\n\r\n"Each sip," they pause to smile, a little contemptuously, "excruciating for the one whose memories have been extracted. But that is Zaira's domain, rather than my own." Isery watches your face, searching for some particular expression. Perhaps they find it, for they clear their throat, and look away. "Glad you asked?"
>>	Name	NOPE
>>	Description	You know, of course. But it's probably a good idea to be sure.
>>>	Teaser	"Oh, my dear...
>>>	Description	"Oh, my dear. I simply couldn't. No. Don't beg. Have you tried asking Zaira? What? You've disappointed her as well? Oh dear. Are you quite sure the life piratical is the one for you?" [The Patrons of the Isle of Cats have no further use for you.]

"I have a delivery for the Alarming Scholar in London," they tell you, over a meal of fungus-blossom and sea-lily soup. "A delivery that needs to pass beneath the notice of the Revenue."\r\n\r\nIsery places a casket on the table, and slides it open with a dull click. Inside are vials of what is unmistakably red honey. It gleams malevolently.

>>>	Teaser	"The Scholar will give you some notes in return...
>>>	Description	"The Scholar will give you some notes in return. Bring them to me, and I shall be most pleased."\r\n\r\nIsery slides the casket over to you, and very pointedly does not enumerate the consequences of returning without the notes. Instead: they smile, too wide, and you shiver.
>>	Name	Accept a new commission

Marvellously Machiavellian. \r\n\r\n"I've heard of your colleagues and their ambitions." Fingers drum on the Diplomat's desk. "Of all London's foes, the Prester is the most intransigent. A blow to him, or his puppeteers, is an opportunity for London. And of course there's the fringe benefit of immortality. I enjoy life, and find myself generally in favour of more of it. \r\n\r\n"Very well: I accept. Your enemies are my enemies; my friends are yours. Let us scheme to Nidah's downfall!"

>	Description	Isery is waiting on the docks when you next arrive at Port Cavendish. Behind them are a pair of courtesans with arms folded forbiddingly. It appears they know that you have returned empty-handed. \r\n\r\n"I hoped, I really did, that you wouldn't place me in this awkward predicament." Isery clasps their claw-jewelled hands to their delicately featured face. "I do so dislike having to make examples of people. It's so <i>messy</i>."

>>>	Description	You are, regrettably, mistaken. The courtesans are corded with muscle under their gauzy silks, and slit the throats of two of your crew as an opening gambit. The rest of the crew - quite wisely - cowers back. You drag your eyes from the corpses just in time to see Isery very calmly claw you across the face. You dream shivering dreams of claws of enamel and bone for several nights after, and count yourself lucky.

>>>	Description	The courtesans are corded with muscle under their gauzy silks, but your crew is determined. One of them falls with a dagger embedded in their eye, and you barely avoid a slash from Isery's jewelled claw. Ten gruesome minutes later, the courtesans are dead and Isery holds up their hands. \r\n\r\n"Oh, all right, all right. You've made your point." Their look of vague bemusement sharpens. "We shall call it even. I am done with you." They walk away, leaving you sweat-soaked and fatigued on the docks.

Instead you find yourself in a well-lit laboratory of book-lined walls and delicate equipment. Isery does not pause in their task of pouring red honey into a cucurbit flask.\r\n\r\n"It is possible to encourage lamplighter bees to seek out one kind of memory over another," they announce, without any preamble. "It's all about what you expose the bee to, once it has drunk the maddening nectar of the crimson roses. But it is an uncertain process. Full of guesswork. The Alarming Scholar and I have been trying to... apply the scientific method, you could say."\r\n\r\nThey look fond for a moment, soft. "I require you to perform a little experiment for me. Shouldn't take long."

>>>	Teaser	"Have you no scientific interest?
>>>	Description	"Have you no scientific interest? None at all?" Isery looks bewildered. "I knew an intern like you, back when I was at Infernal Rarefactions. Found her drowned in a cucumber sandwich one afternoon. Quite put me off my lunch."\r\n\r\nThey dismiss you, and you leave with alacrity. You doubt your services will be required again.
>>	Name	Perhaps not
>>	Description	You are not sure that maddened bees and intense emotions should be mixed, especially not near your own precious person. [Refusal will lock you out of Isery's patronage.]

>	Description	"I have been singing your praises to Leopold." Isery's eyes warm at the name. You could almost envy the Pirate-King. Almost. "I would like to introduce you to him, yes - I think it is time."\r\n\r\nThey make a mime of thoughtfulness, though each word they say is carefully measured. "But when one meets a king, one needs exactly the right sort of gift. It's only polite."

>	Description	Your Patron offers the Pirate-King the wine-glass. The King takes a sip, and the prisoner cries out as though his skin is being flayed from his bones. "The spice-scented docks of Malacca," Leopold breathes, before he is plucked away by the honey.\r\n\r\nHe returns hours later, skin flushed and eyes bright. "I am very partial to memories of the Far East. Very thoughtful of you."\r\n\r\nHe bestows a humming, honey-soaked kiss on Isery's lips, and then Zaira's, before holding out the vial to you.

You-in-the-memory turn your face to the right and there she is: Kembang. \r\n\r\nYou met her three weeks ago serving drinks by the docks. Her father threatened to break your legs if you so much as looked at her, but you cannot help yourself. Her hands are softer than anything you have ever imagined, and dappled in warm sunlight. The curve of her smile slices into you like a blade - \r\n\r\nYou come back to yourself in a sudden rush. You are lying on the floor alone, your face wet with stolen tears. On the desk: a Key to the Cage Gardens, which you slip into your pocket, and a gold statuette of a tiger, with eyes of polished ruby. Something about the statuette makes you decidedly uneasy. Still, it will probably sell for a good price.
>>	Name	Take a sip
>>	Description	The prisoner gazes at the ceiling blankly, with no sign of his earlier distress. 
>>>	Teaser	"Perhaps some mushroom wine instead?
>>>	Description	"Perhaps some mushroom wine instead? I sometimes wish I had never drunk of the rose's honey. It is one thing to know that you are damned, and another to feel it, in the very marrow and blood." Leopold grimaces. "For me it was not - altogether - a choice."\r\n\r\nHe take the brooch of amber cat's eyes and replaces it with a little silver key strung on a chain. "A Key to the Cage-Gardens. A sign of my trust." He then presses a gold statuette of a tiger into your hands. It has eyes of polished ruby; it makes you decidedly uneasy to look into them. Still. It'll fetch a good price. "You are always welcome in Port Cavendish, my friend. We are a haven for all those who are free."

"Here, you take my mask and pretend to be me, and I'll trade in the visitor mask and get on some departing ship. Get my life back."\r\n\r\nIts face - no, now you see, her face - is aging but unlined. A lifetime of never needing to use a facial expression.
>>>	Name	It is keen to go
>>	Name	Trade masks with the Moon-Moth
>>	Description	It has been making subtle overtures for some time. You only now understand them.
>>>	Teaser	You say farewell to the Moon-Moth...
>>>	Description	You say farewell to the Moon-Moth. It makes gestures you now recognise as agitation. Perhaps there was some other plan for you here, but no one consulted you about it. You have other things to attend to.\r\n\r\nYour last sight of Visage: the Moth smoothing the folds from your robe and hanging your mask on a peg for the next visitor.
>>>	Name	A shame about the Moth
>>	Name	End your performance and leave the island
>>	Description	You can't stay in character forever.

>	Description	All the denizens of Visage are walking towards the Ear together. There is a place in the procession which belongs by right to the wearer of your mask.
>	Name	Festival of Flourishing
>>>	Teaser	You go as though you were truly one of them...
>>>	Description	You go as though you were truly one of them. You carry nothing with you but your mask and your costume.\r\n\r\n"May your heart be as light as a feather," says the woman in the lotus-blossom mask, as you fall into line behind her.
>>>	Name	Among your own
>>	Name	Fall in line with the others
>>	Description	How else will you discover what lies within?
>>>	Teaser	It is a risk to bring it, but it would also be a risk to go without...
>>>	Description	It is a risk to bring it, but it would also be a risk to go without. You conceal the flare in the folds of your robe and fall into the procession.\r\n\r\n"May your sins weigh as stone," says the man in the jackal face, as you fall into line ahead of him.
>>>	Name	Ritual disobedience
>>	Name	Fall in line with the others, secretly bringing a flare with you
>>	Description	Perhaps you will need it, in the darkness where you are going.
>>>	Teaser	When the procession has passed, you strip away your mask and costume and leave them on the floor in the Customs House...
>>>	Description	When the procession has passed, you strip away your mask and costume and leave them on the floor in the Customs House. The arms you fold neatly across themselves in the fashion that is appropriate for this particular robe. \r\n\r\nPerhaps someone after you will care to take up your role.
>>>	Name	Farewell to this island
>>	Name	Strip off your mask and prepare to depart
>>	Description	With everyone distracted by this festival, your departure would not even be noticed.

>	Description	The road you follow leads up through switchbacks along the side of the face, and finally to the ear of Flourishing-of-Years, and into the cave that is her ear. The tunnel bends back on itself and all lights have now been extinguished. There is nothing to guide you but the hand of the person behind you on your back, and the movement of the person in front of you. \r\n\r\nThe one who walks beside you wears a bat mask.\r\n\r\nFortunately the floor of the tunnel is very smooth and presents no stumbling blocks. Sound carries strangely in this place, however. Sometimes you cannot hear your own footsteps, and sometimes a breath comes back to you audible from someplace ahead in line.
>	Name	Inside the Hollow of the Ear
>>>	Teaser	You try to stop and turn, but there are hands on your shoulders, and steady feet behind you...
>>>	Description	You try to stop and turn, but there are hands on your shoulders, and steady feet behind you. The passage is narrower and the stone walls are closer than you had thought they were.\r\n\r\nYou cannot go out. There are too many people in too little space. And if anyone were to roll a boulder into the ear of Flourishing-of-Years, then you would be trapped here and there would be no recourse.\r\n\r\n"Steady on," says Bat-mask beside you. His accent is the accent of Wolfstack Docks. \r\n\r\nA moment later there's a pungent ammonia smell, as though he's cracked open smelling salts for you, though in this pure black you can't see a thing for sure.
>>>	Name	No escape route
>>	Name	Try to run
>>	Description	You do not really know what this festival is or what it means.
>>>	Teaser	The footsteps of the people are steady and synchronized, and you go together...
>>>	Description	The footsteps of the people are steady and synchronized, and you go together. For how many years has this been done, and for how many will it be done in the future?\r\n\r\n"Watch your step here," says Bat-mask to you in an undervoice. Its accent is the accent of Wolfstack Docks. "Floor is about to get squishier." And sure enough it does.
>>>	Name	In line
>>	Name	Continue
>>	Description	There is a secret in the dark.
>	Teaser	At last the tunnel opens out...
>	Description	At last the tunnel opens out. You and all the other congregants spread out in a cavernous space.\r\n\r\nA voice speaks in the darkness, a ritual preparation: "Here at the new year, we gather under the One Mask of Flourishing-of-Years. Her face is turned to the gods.\r\n\r\n"Protected by her mask, we may remove our own. Protected by her script, we may speak outside our parts."\r\n\r\nHere and there is the sound of people fumbling with ties and strings. Your own face feels different with the mask off.
>	Name	Deep Within
>>>	Teaser	You move stealthily through the dark, hearing one knot of conversation and then another...
>>>	Description	You move stealthily through the dark, hearing one knot of conversation and then another.\r\n\r\nThe secrets exchanged do not offer much leverage. You can't see the owners of the secrets. Here and there you catch the smallest fragment of something that might serve you on a future occasion: the memory of a voyage east, a half-rumour about the Carnelian Coast, a muttering about the Admiralty.
>>>	Name	Not much for blackmail
>>	Name	Wait, listen
>>	Description	There are things here to learn, perhaps to your advantage.
>>>	Teaser	You begin to speak...
>>>	Description	You begin to speak. Certain weights lift away. You have been in the wrong from time to time, but it is forgivable.
>>>	Name	Strangely liberating
>>	Name	Tell one of your own secrets
>>	Description	All this time under the mask. It would be freeing.
>>>	Teaser	The trouble is, once you've realized that you're trapped, it's hard to unrealize it again...
>>>	Description	The trouble is, once you've realized that you're trapped, it's hard to unrealize it again.\r\n\r\nSomeone squeezes your wrist. Grounds you. The panic goes out again in a rush.
>>>	Name	Grace
>>	Name	Fight the urge to panic
>>	Description	The room may have got bigger, but you are still trapped like a bug in a bottle.
>>>	Teaser	You manage to stifle yourself...
>>>	Description	You manage to stifle yourself. The only thing that comes out sounds like a sneeze.\r\n\r\nHere and there people are talking around you, telling of childhoods in padded nurseries, silenced under the Scarab-shaped baby mask. Other pasts, too, not all lived on Visage.
>>>	Name	Suppressed
>>	Name	Fight the urge to giggle
>>	Description	What curious practices they have here.
>>>	Teaser	In the deep shadow you hear things that you will never repeat...
>>>	Description	In the deep shadow you hear things that you will never repeat. They are not the most dreadful of secrets or the most evil things you know, but they are entrusted to you as confessions. \r\n\r\nYou needn't guard your face while you listen, because no one can see you. You needn't scheme about how to use the information, because you do not know whose secret this is: it has no use to you, except as a token of connection.
>>>	Name	Truths
>>	Name	Receive the confidence of a stranger as holy
>>	Description	Those who come as spectators may remain as participants.

>	Name	Ritual's End
>>>	Teaser	The light is so sudden, so searing, that someone screams...
>>>	Description	The light is so sudden, so searing, that someone screams. All around you are... all sorts of things. Some are human, but you see other faces: rubbery, clay, some unrecognizably altered. The Chief Geometer, with his mask off, doesn't seem to be bothering to wear a face at all. Many faces are wet with tears. No one welcomes the blaze of light.\r\n\r\nSomeone throws a cloak over the flare: a mistake, because of course it only begins to burn. After that someone manages to douse both flare and cloak. (Who in this crowd was carrying a bucket of water?) But it is put out, and someone's hands are clamped firm around your wrist.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the last that you see of Visage. You are taken blind back to the docks, your face covered in a black cloth that is no mask at all.
>>>	Name	Ouch
>>	Name	Set off a flare, allowing you to see everyone
>>	Description	You will see everything. [This will certainly get you kicked off the island.]

After that someone manages to douse both flare and cloak. (Who in this crowd was carrying a bucket of water?) But it is put out.\r\n\r\nYou do get out, though. You're escorted back up the tunnel, double-quick, and no business about having to wait your turn in an endless file of people. The cold sea air is on your face.
>>>	Name	Out, out out
>>	Name	Set off a flare, lighting this place up
>>	Description	You will see everything. [This will certainly get you kicked off the island.]
>>>	Teaser	You hood the flare inside a lantern, but it's still distressfully bright in here...
>>>	Description	You hood the flare inside a lantern, but it's still distressfully bright in here.\r\n\r\nYou shine the light on your companion. A man only, with a broad nose that looks like it has been broken repeatedly, and a missing tooth, and scars about the neck as though he has been executed many times. He gives you a sad, sheepish grin. \r\n\r\n"Nothing to see here," he says. "And they'll be putting me to death again soon enough, so you needn't have bothered."\r\n\r\nAlready the others are swarming on him. Before your light goes out, you catch a glimpse of a noose, ready in someone's hand. The bats are not welcome here, it seems.\r\n\r\nThough after your violation of the mask-darkness, you aren't welcome either.
>>>	Name	Bat
>>	Name	Shine a light on the bat-faced figure
>>	Description	Really it's just him you want to understand. [This will certainly get you kicked off the island.]
>>>	Teaser	At the end of the hour there comes a woman with a feather of shimmering silver, which she tucks into your hand...
>>>	Description	At the end of the hour there comes a woman with a feather of shimmering silver, which she tucks into your hand. Symbol of the innocent heart that will not be eaten by the jackal. \r\n\r\nThen a bell rings and the time of speech is over. You all begin to put your masks back on. It is possible - you cannot know for sure - that in this cover someone has exchanged a mask with someone else.\r\n\r\nIt is an orderly and perfect line that emerges again from the ear of Flourishing-of-Years. If anyone watches from above, they must surely be satisfied. 
>>>	Name	Last bell

>>>	Teaser	Moon-Moth unfolds and folds its wings...
>>>	Description	Moon-Moth unfolds and folds its wings. "Not suitable," it says. "On Visage everyone is masked. To walk on the island with your own face would give scandal."
>>>	Name	No?
>>	Name	Ask to go about without any mask
>>	Description	Your own fair face will do for you, thanks very much.
>>>	Teaser	Moon-Moth explains: each mask declares a different intention towards the denizens of Visage, and must be accompanied by suitable behavior...
>>>	Description	Moon-Moth explains: each mask declares a different intention towards the denizens of Visage, and must be accompanied by suitable behavior. The Frog is for visitors who, though perhaps clumsy and unfamiliar with local etiquette, have come in order to observe local ways and to make uncouth comments about them. \r\n\r\nThe Locust is for those who seek profit in Visage and would carry away as many goods as possible.\r\n\r\nYou prompt about the Bat. Moon Moth hesitates. "Bat is an ill-omened visitor. Sent as a messenger or a spy. Bat always dies."
>>>	Name	Assorted pestilences
>>	Name	Ask the significance of the masks
>>	Description	Maybe there's more to it than a question of aesthetic taste.
>>>	Teaser	Moon-Moth lifts the mask and places it over your head...
>>>	Description	Moon-Moth lifts the mask and places it over your head. The eye holes are large and they are fitted with spectacles. These improve your view of the environment, though you must look bulb-eyed from the outside. There is also a mechanism attached to the mouth piece which magnifies any sounds you make, even your breathing. You start to thank the Moon-Moth and it comes out as a booming croak.\r\n\r\n"May you profit from your visit in knowledge," says Moon-Moth. Its wings fold neatly over its back.
>>>	Name	Brekkekkekek
>>	Name	Choose the frog mask
>>	Description	It looks curious.
>>>	Teaser	Moon-Moth settles the locust mask over your head...
>>>	Description	Moon-Moth settles the locust mask over your head. The eyeholes are covered with a thin gold film through which valuable objects gleam more brightly.\r\n\r\n"May you find a happy harvest," says Moon-Moth. \r\n\r\nThen, when you have partly turned away, it double-knots the ties on its purse, as though you're likely to pick its pockets. Doesn't it know you can see it?
>>>	Name	Hunger for all things
>>	Name	Choose the locust mask
>>	Description	It looks voracious.
>>>	Teaser	Moon-Moth spreads and folds its wings...
>>>	Description	Moon-Moth spreads and folds its wings. (Are those part of the moth costume? It looks that way, but one cannot rule out the possibility that Moth has real wings.)\r\n\r\n"My condolences," it says, with polite formality, as it sets the bat mask on your face and ties the worn leather straps around the back of your head. The inside of the mask smells of musk.
>>>	Name	Messenger with no message
>>	Name	Choose the bat mask
>>	Description	It looks threatening.

>	Description	Moon Moth stands to one side, as your escort and tour guide.
>	Name	Flood Court
>>>	Teaser	From a corner Moon Moth picks up a graduated stick...
>>>	Description	From a corner Moon Moth picks up a graduated stick. He shows you how a person standing at the end of the room may dip the stick into the water and use it to measure the water level at a pre-selected point, and how the measurements are compared with measurements written on a calendar. If the water level does not match the calendrical position, an assembly of pipes and drains is used to adjust it.\r\n\r\n"It used to be," says the Moth, "that the water rose and fell of its own accord, and the People Before wrote down what height it reached. Now the water is still, but thanks to their actions, we can replicate the rise and fall so as still to be pleasing to the God of Flood."\r\n\r\nIt completes this explanation with a half-body bow towards the statue of the ram-deity.
>>>	Name	Depth per day
>>	Name	Ask about the purpose of this room
>>	Description	It doesn't really look as though it's good for anything.
>>>	Teaser	You exclaim at how much you admire this room and its excellent pool...
>>>	Description	You exclaim at how much you admire this room and its excellent pool. Your words are, as always, amplified into a croak. Other masks turn towards you (crocodile, lotus blossom, crescent moon) but no one speaks. You have garnered a suitable degree of disdain.\r\n\r\nMoon Moth quietly applauds your performance of froghood.
>>>	Name	Croak.
>>	Name	Show oafish enthusiasm for this wonderful indoor pool
>>	Description	Frogs like pools, right?
>>>	Teaser	You make a grab for the jug and come away with a tiny fragment of paint-daubed clay...
>>>	Description	You make a grab for the jug and come away with a tiny fragment of paint-daubed clay. \r\n\r\nMoon Moth looks scandalized that you would attempt something so locust-like. It hurries you back outside, chittering to itself. Perhaps theft requires a different mask here. At any rate, you're not allowed to keep this one.
>>>	Name	Not your role
>>	Name	Try to steal the statue's jug
>>	Description	It looks ancient, and consequently valuable.
>>>	Teaser	Moon Moth looks scandalized that you would attempt something so bat-like...
>>>	Description	Moon Moth looks scandalized that you would attempt something so bat-like. It hurries you back outside, chittering to itself. Perhaps you needed a different mask?\r\n\r\nAt any rate, you're not allowed to keep this one. It's back to the dock for you.
>>>	Name	Not your role
>>	Name	Spy on the other occupants
>>	Description	Close watch is what they need.
>>>	Teaser	Moon Moth watches inscrutably while you talk about other bodies of water that have impressed you more than this one...
>>>	Description	Moon Moth watches inscrutably while you talk about other bodies of water that have impressed you more than this one. Deeper, clearer, colder, more densely populated with fish.\r\n\r\nOther denizens move away from you, and towards one another. Your social function is well performed.
>>>	Name	Have you seen the Cumaean Canal?
>>	Name	Tastelessly compare this room to other bodies of water
>>	Description	Frogs know water.
>>>	Teaser	Moon Moth looks around while you speak...
>>>	Description	Moon Moth looks around while you speak. Several of the other masks have heard you. "What are you, a Bat?"\r\n\r\nIt seems this is not the sort of thing that Locusts are supposed to say, supposed to think. Your role is to desire and acquire. Not to notice. Not to exclaim. Not to feel joy or admiration or dread.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours later, you are back at the docks, half-naked. Your locust mask is gone, and with it the strange glimmering tint that it cast on the whole world. You'll remember that.
>>>	Name	Not for you
>>	Name	Say how much you like the pool
>>	Description	The way the surface of the water is so still even a few inches from where it's being poured in. Impressive. Strange.
>>>	Teaser	You don't get far...
>>>	Description	You don't get far. The Moon-Moth determines that you're up to some obscure act of counterfeiting or coinage-related espionage.\r\n\r\nIt expects you to explore. Then it expects you to be punished for exploring. That is what happens to Bats.\r\n\r\nYou end up scarred and maskless, back at the dock.
>>>	Name	More of a Locust activity
>>	Name	Try to collect coins from the bottom of the pool
>>	Description	There are a large number of them.
>>>	Teaser	Moon Moth looks at you without surprise...
>>>	Description	Moon Moth looks at you without surprise. (Of course without surprise. No such expression can register on a mask. But without the small gestures of agitation that accompany a mistake on your part.) \r\n\r\nIt expects you to ask questions. Then it expects you to be punished for asking. That is what happens to Bats.\r\n\r\nYou end up scarred and maskless, back at the dock.
>>>	Name	Infiltrator
>>	Name	Say how much you like the pool
>>	Description	The way the surface of the water is so still even a few inches from where it's being poured in. Impressive. Strange.
>>>	Teaser	You wade into the water and begin gathering coins...
>>>	Description	You wade into the water and begin gathering coins. People watch you from behind their masks. Moon Moth looks uncertain: you're playing the role of locust flawlessly, but these are sacred.\r\n\r\nYou hesitate for just a moment, your will wavering, and that's enough. The others rush you and drive you out. But you are not made to leave the city, at any rate.
>>>	Name	Take?
>>>	Teaser	You wade into the water and begin gathering coins...
>>>	Description	You wade into the water and begin gathering coins. People watch you from behind their masks, but no one tries to stop you. \r\n\r\nAfter a moment, the other locust masks in the room swarm with you, four and five and six of you together, scraping up the coins from the bottom of the pool, working your way along until everything is gone. \r\n\r\nIt is just how a locust ought to behave.
>>>	Name	Gotcha
>>	Name	Gather coin from the Flood Court floor
>>	Description	Apparently people use it as a wishing well.
>>>	Teaser	The sigils are tiny pictures, and the tiny pictures yield a meaning if you stare long enough...
>>>	Description	The sigils are tiny pictures, and the tiny pictures yield a meaning if you stare long enough. You are catching something, something about an ancient river and floods that were, when you are interrupted.\r\n\r\nThe Moon Moth does not like you staring at the fragments. Does not like it, and accuses you of being a Bat in disguise, and casts you out.\r\n\r\nYou'll have to come back later, in a new mask.
>>>	Name	Heights and depths
>>>	Teaser	The sigils are tiny pictures, and the tiny pictures yield a meaning if you stare long enough...
>>>	Description	The sigils are tiny pictures, and the tiny pictures yield a meaning if you stare long enough. The calendar remembers the heights and depths of an ancient river, one that flowed far away and long ago. It remembers cycles of farming time and flood time and drought time. It remembers a circular stasis, a way of being that repeated in just the same fashion for hundreds of generations.\r\n\r\nThe Moon Moth does not like you staring at the fragments. Does not like it, and accuses you of being a Bat in disguise, and casts you out.\r\n\r\nThat is also part of a cycle.
>>>	Name	Heights and depths
>>	Name	Study the calendars drawn on the walls
>>	Description	You don't recognise the language, but the repeating pattern of days is unmistakeable.

>>>	Description	The rats are accepted but immediately passed on to the household cat - a sleek black satisfied creature, in its own small mask of filigree gold. \r\n\r\nAwkwardly, this leaves you with no other gift for the Geometer himself. You have no choice to depart early, before someone thinks to have you re-masked in a more embarrassing part.
>>>	Name	For the cat
>>	Name	Bring a string of rats

>>>	Teaser	He gives them to a servant with orders that they be crushed, and the powder made to pigment, and the pigment used for painting...
>>>	Description	He gives them to a servant with orders that they be crushed, and the powder made to pigment, and the pigment used for painting. It is uncertain whether this is a deadly insult.\r\n\r\nYou aren't thrown out of the house, at any rate.
>>>	Name	Feeling blue
>>	Name	Bring a necklet of lapis beads
>>	Description	If they do not suit him, they may suit a wife of his; if they don't suit her, he can use them for an offering.
>>>	Teaser	He appears to be pleased by this gift, but it takes him aback, as well...
>>>	Description	He appears to be pleased by this gift, but it takes him aback, as well. Several times he remarks that this sort of merchandise is something he would expect to be brought to the island by a Bat.\r\n\r\nIt requires a great deal of chittering and wing-folding to persuade him of your Moth nature.
>>>	Name	Mixed results
>>	Name	Bring a poem concerning snakes, copied on a new scroll
>>	Description	800 lines on the scaly denizens of the snake pit.
>>>	Teaser	Flung away into a corner! -

>>>	Description	The gift is suited to him personally: one can see this by the way that he hesitates regretfully before he performs the rejection that etiquette requires. It was thoughtful, but it is not the gift of Moth to Cobra. Therefore, wrong.
>>>	Name	Hunger set aside
>>	Name	Bring fresh candles

>>>	Teaser	He accepts; he approves...
>>>	Description	He accepts; he approves. The cakes are placed on the front table of his receiving room so that the other guests may observe and appreciate the correctness of your gesture. \r\n\r\nYou are permitted to stand to one side and to watch the others arrive, but there is no one whose gift supplants yours in the place of honor. Not even the gift of a preserved lark, frozen in gelatin with a bubble of song rising from its open beak.\r\n\r\nWhen you depart the Chief Geometer's house, he presses on you a prediction: that one day when you have most need, the earth will swallow you in one place and spit you out in another. It is, of course, only a ritual saying.
>>>	Name	Triumph
>>	Name	Bring two honey cakes

"Best to proceed as if it is the first, don't you think?"\r\n\r\nA veil of gold-mesh obscures only her eyes, leaving her glistening, bitten lips bare. Perhaps a hundred small silver keys jangle in a bunch at her left hip. "I think we should be friends. I'm very important you know - or I was. No, still am." She pauses. "Yes, I am quite sure I still am."

>>>	Teaser	Moon-Moth explains...
>>>	Description	Moon-Moth explains. People think it means something like 'library of fragments', but this is wrong.\r\n\r\nThe parts in question are like parts in a play. This is where the denizens of Visage come in order to learn how to perform their masks more accurately, more completely, with a truer spirit.

>>>	Description	Taking the nearest, you read it aloud: 'For guarding against the loss of the heart.' \r\n\r\nMoon-Moth takes it from you, rolls it tightly, and returns it to its niche. "There are as many ways of guarding against the loss of the heart as there are different masks," it explains, in that same light and indifferent voice.

>>>	Description	Moon-Moth is startled. Apparently no other Frog has gone so far as to attempt to deface the library's holdings. It gets the pen away from you, expostulating.\r\n\r\nLater you find it writing down a record of what you just did. To be added to the Library of Parts, a recollection of what can be expected from frogs.

>>>	Teaser	You go from niche to niche, putting scrolls into your pockets...
>>>	Description	You go from niche to niche, putting scrolls into your pockets.\r\n\r\nMoon-Moth intervenes. This is a Locust activity, not proper for you at all. It expects you to spy instead. Then it expects you to be taken to the place of execution and hung upside down. This is what happens to Bats in Visage.\r\n\r\nThe penalty for misplaying your role is only a little better than the penalty for being a Bat. You end up scarred and maskless, back at the dock.

>>>	Description	Moon-Moth considers you. Perhaps it thinks you are acting too much like a Frog. Perhaps it thinks this is a Bat gambit to gain favour. Misplaying your role would be bad, and correctly playing the Bat would be worse. \r\n\r\nEither way, there are penalties. You end up scarred and maskless, back at the dock.

Each ritual records which citizen cleared the door for entry and which masks were present in the procession. \r\n\r\nThere are references, oblique but suggestive, that the ritual began long after the Ear was built, 'when the new people came to Visage.' But why they came, and what happened to the old people, is not recorded.\r\n\r\nAnd there is never any record about what was said inside the Ear.

But why they came, and what happened to the old people, is not recorded.\r\n\r\nAnd then, this most recent ritual: it is recorded as having been "corrupted by light."\r\n\r\n \r\nAh.

>>>	Description	She appears to be reading poetry, but you catch no more than a few references to petals before she sees that you're lurking. Her body folds in on itself, flower returning to bud form.\r\n\r\nThe Moon-Moth does not like you doing this. Does not like it, and accuses you of being a Bat in disguise, and casts you out.
>>>	Name	Bud form

>>>	Description	She appears to be reading poetry: something about the blossom that folds away beneath the water at night, and blooms again in the daytime. She frowns as she reads, and goes back over and over the same passages, as though committing them to memory. As though it is very important for her to have every syllable by heart.\r\n\r\nShe is too absorbed to notice you there, but the Moon-Moth is not. It does not like to see you interfering, and accuses you of being a Bat in disguise, and casts you out.

>>>	Description	Your every move is exaggerated, made louder and more bumbling, by your foolish costume. Moon-Moth finds you with one big flappy glove wrapped around a gilt-edged scroll. He takes it away and escorts you back to the customs house.\r\n\r\n"If you are greedy, return to us as a locust," he says. "But do not do locust-deeds from under a frog-mask."
>>>	Name	Not your role

>>>	Description	The trouble about your costume is that it amplifies all of your movements; and since everyone is used to hearing you coming and going, even when you succeed in being stealthy, your silence is notable anyway. So it is a considerable coup that you manage to filch one of the scrolls edged in gilt and illustrated in lapis, and tuck it into the giant rubbery belly of your costume.\r\n\r\nIt is probably a coincidence that the Moon-Moth declares your visit to be at an end, shortly afterward.

>>>	Description	You dip your fingers into a Crocodile's purse and acquire a few coppers from a Heron. From the way the Heron flinches, you know she knows you're there. Apparently it is the etiquette of the place not to prevent a Locust from stealing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps for the same reason, the coins are no more than tiny copper chips each stamped with an eye sigil. Practically worthless.

>>>	Description	You dip your fingers into a Crocodile's purse and acquire a few coppers from a Heron. The coins here are no more than tiny copper chips each stamped with an eye sigil: the exchange rate must be thousands of these to the Echo, hardly worth taking home.\r\n\r\nBut you have acted as a Locust is meant to act, anyhow. There are no scrolls for locusts in the Library of Parts.

On the desk is an open casket: within are ten gleaming vials of red honey, carefully packed.\r\n\r\n"Freshly harvested by the Melliferous Sisters. Touch them, go on. They're still warm from the honey-spinner!" Zaira turns toward you. "They are for the Merchant Venturer, over in London. You'll take them for me, won't you? Unless you already have? No. Clearly not. No."

"I drank the memories of someone that went to school with him." You must make some sort of sound, because she gives you a little shrug. "I like to know my business partners. It was Leopold's idea, of course. He's very thorough."

>>>	Description	Zaira does not waste time with words: she slips a long, thin dagger out of her sleeve and cuts the throats of two of your crew. The dagger is pressed to your own throat before you can even give a shout of horror. "Violence! I remember violence!" She laughs breathily. "Do you think I should kill you?"\r\n\r\nYou don't. You really don't. "Oh, all right then." She shoves you with her free hand, and you tumble into the freezing zeewater. Your crew fish you out once she departs.
>>>	Teaser	Zaira does not take kindly to being threatened...
>>>	Description	Zaira does not take kindly to being threatened. She pulls a thin dagger from her sleeve and slashes at you. You throw yourself out of the way. The docks are close, and narrow, but you manage to evade her again, then again. She hisses in frustration and stabs one of your crew.\r\n\r\n"I've always wanted to stab someone in the neck. Haven't I? Yes. Yes." She wipes off the dagger on her dress, and waggles it at you. "We are done. We never were. I have already forgotten you." She spits at your feet, and walks away.

Zaira looks confused for a moment, and then stamps her foot in a charade of rage. "You are banished from my presence! Begone, foul disappointment!" She gives you a wink, before her face clears. "But really, I am rather cross. Yes? Mmm. I probably won't kill you. But one never quite knows, does one?"

>	Description	Before you is a garden washed with blood. A sea of petalled crimson. They say these particular exile's roses are of a variety cross-bred with a flower from Hell. That would explain the stench of brimstone, underneath the sweetness. \r\n\r\nWinding paths lead to irregular rows of cages, each covered in tangles of thorn and vine. Some of the prisoners inside the cages call out to you, others mutter to themselves, or weep. A few simply stare, hopeless and silent.\r\n\r\n"Good. You're here." Zaira snips a rose-head with her shears. "I'd like a new addition to the Garden. Could I borrow one of your crew? Well. <i>Have</i> one, really. I doubt you'd want them back, after."

"Your face is a sunset, Captain."\r\n\r\n"Oh. Yes! You are exactly right. What a way with words you have." Zaira gives the engineer a fond look. "Your memories are going to be quite the prize, I can tell. I shall have to get you to write them down, so we can compare impressions later. Won't that be fun?"\r\n\r\nYou leave them chattering together, after making sure the Engineer's cage is properly locked. Perhaps it is better this way? You tell yourself that you have never seen the Engineer happier.

"I didn't expect - this outcome isn't on any of my lists!"\r\n\r\nZaira locks the Cannoneer into the cage personally. "Saltpetre and lit matches. Hot iron. What memories you must have. Sipping them will be like swallowing an explosion, all fire and light." \r\n\r\nThe Cannoneer refuses to look away from you until you make some excuse to leave. They probably won't even recognise you, the next time you return. That's something, at least.
>>	Name	Offer her the Irrepressible Cannoneer
>>	Description	You should probably warn her about the Cannoneer's tendency towards explosions. [You will be well rewarded. Be sure to have 20 free spaces in your cargo hold.]
>>>	Teaser	"Nightmarish?
>>>	Description	"Nightmarish? You really think so? Well, you must have odd dreams." Zaira takes a deep breath, and exhales it out all at once. "This place is full of peace. Do I mean peace? Yes, I think I do. Serenity. Stillness. The roses are innocent, even though they half-sprung from hell. You don't find that worth something? Maybe in your position I'd - well. Then I'd be you, and where would that leave <i>us</i>?"\r\n\r\nShe brightens all of a sudden. "Actually, in much the same place. Isn't the universe an odd thing! Goodbye, captain.

An oil-bearded wretch with a brace of pistols strapped to each hip, and eyes like wildfire? A gaunt-cheeked honey-seeker wasted from years of dissolution?\r\n\r\nHe looks, as it turns out, more like a lawyer than a dissolute lord - though he is at least wearing a robe of patterned-silk over his dark suit. Behind him you see a wall of what you think are wine-racks. On closer inspection, the racks hold bottle upon carefully labelled bottle of red honey.

She claps, and a laugh echoes from her twisting lips. "Or maybe that was someone else. It most probably was. Don't you think? It sounds very far-fetched, now that I say it out loud."\r\n\r\nA breeze lifts her gold-mesh veil: there is a shadowed emptiness where her eyes should be, and livid scars all around. The sort a nectar-maddened lamplighter bee might leave, when it burrowed into a brain. You shiver a little, and give no answer.

Some children nearby are playing an unfamiliar game involving skipping stones and swapping feathered masks. You-in-the-memory are peeling the skin from a round, translucent fruit. The sharp taste of it chases the honey-sweetness from your mouth. You taste that ghost-taste on your tongue for days after, longed-for and familiar.

>>>	Teaser	You taste the honey, and then your mouth fills with blood...
>>>	Description	You taste the honey, and then your mouth fills with blood. A fight! You-in-the-memory feels a hand squeezing your neck. A dull pain in your left knee. Your fingers fumbling for a knife, just ever so slightly out of reach. You spit a tooth into your assailant's eye, and she flinches back. Your fingers close around the knife, and you slash her across the cheek. The whitish substance of her eye leaks down her face, and she howls into the false-starred sky.\r\n\r\nIs there a dead woman writhing in some strange hell, as you steal her memories? Death, in the Neath, is so rarely a release.
>>	Name	An occluded vial

>>>	Teaser	The guards fling the Drownie into the pool...
>>>	Description	The guards fling the Drownie into the pool. The splash soaks the King, but his dignity is unmarred. The pulsing in the pool intensifies into threshing. The Drownie sinks from view, and the waters grow thick and dark. "Next," the King says peaceably.
>>>	Name	A spray of seawater
>>	Name	Witness an execution
>>	Description	Two silent guards in thorned exoskeletons drag a babbling Drownie forwards. "No!" she shrieks. "I am no friend of spiders! I have never purchased silk! It was a gift! Your Complexity! I have always been loyal - "

>>>	Description	He's speaking of the nature of the wounds - their dramatic effects on the landscapes of the body. He sounds like he's boasting - but a single tear trickles down from beneath his mask. At last the King nods. "The offering is acceptable," he says. Thorn-armoured guards carry the bier through a dark slit behind his throne.\r\n\r\nThe King begins, off-handedly, to outline the cartography of the deep undersea, and the patrol-routes of monsters. He notices your presence and snaps his fingers: the guard ushers you out, but not before you've heard valuable deep-gossip.

>>>	Description	At last the King nods, and awards the Emissary a pouch of drowning-pearls. The hour of audience is past. Thorn-armoured guards escort you back to the surface. But the Emissary's words, and the King's questions, have taught you a great deal.
>>>	Name	Valuable information
>>	Name	Listen to a Khaganian Emissary

>>>	Teaser	The King makes a chopping motion with his hand...
>>>	Description	The King makes a chopping motion with his hand. A tide of crabs rushes from the shadows of the Throne-Cyst. They're on the hunter before he can turn, but not before he can scream. The King watches in satisfaction as they swarm the hunter, snipping the flesh from his bones. Thorn-armoured guards block the chamber door.\r\n\r\nWhen it's done; when his cries are long silenced, and scarred bones remain - the King motions you forwards. "Take something," he commands. "Let our justice be remembered above. You may go."
>>>	Name	An abrupt end
>>	Name	Listen to a Chelonate Envoy

>>>	Description	Crocodile is describing the wounds on the body, but the wounds he describes don't match the wounds you see. This is another Visage ritual. He sounds like he's boasting - but a single tear trickles down from beneath his mask. At last the King nods. "The offering is acceptable," he says. Thorn-armoured guards carry the bier through a dark slit behind his throne.\r\n\r\nThe King begins, off-handedly, to outline the cartography of the deep undersea, and the patrol-routes of monsters. He notices your presence and snaps his fingers. The guard ushers you out, but not before you've heard valuable deep-gossip. And you understand a little more Visage-lore. Crocodile has given this body to another kind of flood.

>>>	Teaser	There are seven courses, each named...
>>>	Description	There are seven courses, each named. It begins with <i>The First Touch on the Skin</i>: a plate of silky white flesh submerged in yellow sauce - fresh, sharp, shocking. Next comes <i>Struggling Against the Current</i>, a fierce terrine of coursing flavours. It leaves the diners watery-eyed and reaching for their wine. Before they recover, bowls of peligin soup are set before them. <i>"Swallowed!"</i> the Poissonnier intones. The taste is deep and rich and heavy, lining the stomach. Several drownies lift the bowls to their lips to catch the last drops.\r\n\r\nA merciful interlude follows. <i>The Surface, High Above</i> is a mild, palate-cleansing mousse. Afterwards comes <i>Lost Breath</i> - a roulade of still-wriggling tentacles; bitter on the tongue's tip, but departing with a long, mellow aftertaste as it slides down the throat. The penultimate course <i>The Abandonment of the Self</i> is spun with sugar and crunchy with salt. Spherical cages of solidified syrup, containing fiery sweetmeats. The filigree cracks between Drownie teeth. The sweetmeats vanish down damp gullets.\r\n\r\nLast of all, <i>The Promise of What is to Follow</i> - a brûléed cream of inexplicable pungency - indescribably more-ish. The diners lean back, bloated. When their senses return, they call for the Poissonnier and congratulate him upon impeccably reproducing the sensation of drowning in culinary form. "It was not drowning," the Fathomking says, his baritone rolling over their babble. "It was love." He raises his glass to the Poissonnier. 
>>>	Name	The Seventh Miracle
>>	Name	Attend the Poissonnier's feast
>>	Description	The Drownie court - soggy, chattering, hungry - populate a table of carved coral. The Poissonnier claps his hands. Your crew scurry in with steaming plates.
>>	Name	Deliver the Cargo of Answers to the Fathomking
>>	Description	The Drownies of Scrimshander asked you to deliver evidence that the Chelonate's history is not all it's made out to be.

>>>	Teaser	His bandages burst! - 
>>>	Description	His bandages burst! Frost-moths clamber from the tatters. Nothing of him remains. The frost-moths - icy wings shining - take to the air, spiral, dissipate, are gone.\r\n\r\nHe won't pay his passage now. At least he's left his belongings for sale.
>>>	Name	A soft explosion
>>	Name	Watch carefully
>>	Description	Something is happening to the man in the bandages. He sighs. He groans. He clutches his chest.
>>>	Teaser	She grumbles and struggles, but you force her ashore...
>>>	Description	She grumbles and struggles, but you force her ashore. The bandaged figures on the dock watch the proceedings with interest. She doesn't pass the Skin-Check. Her possesions are forfeited: half of them fall due to you. "You'll be sorry!" she yells as the tomb-colonists drag her away.
>>>	Name	Exposure
>>	Name	Make no promise of discretion
>>	Description	Keep your nose clean. You'll drop her off at the dock, as you promised, and after that, it's her problem.
>>>	Teaser	"I had no idea the place would be quite so unprepossessing...
>>>	Description	"I had no idea the place would be quite so unprepossessing. Perhaps we can liven it up a little, yet. If only I knew a helpful zee-captain..." [Bring ten units of Mushroom Wine to Venderbight, and perhaps they'll have something for you.]
>>>	Name	A plan!
>>	Name	Days of Shrooms and Roses
>>	Description	The new tomb-colonist surveys Venderbight, shaking her head. "It won't do," she says. "It won't do at all."
>>>	Teaser	"Salt tells me that you'll find my father in the belly of a monstrous eel...
>>>	Description	"Salt tells me that you'll find my father in the belly of a monstrous eel. Gods never lie."\r\n\r\nGods never lie? That seems optimistic. But if she's right, she'll reward you for her father's return.
>>>	Name	A fisherman's tale
>>	Name	The New Jonah
>>	Description	Your passenger stands sombrely by the rail. "Salt sent me a dream," she insists. "You must find my father."
>>>	Teaser	"She went off to the Mangrove College...
>>>	Description	"She went off to the Mangrove College. She needed to get out of London. But Venderbight is just as safe as the College. And I'll wager she's bored of mud by now." [Look for the Shady Sort in the Mangrove College, somewhere in the south of the Unterzee.]
>>>	Name	A vague commission
>>	Name	An Absent Friend

>>>	Teaser	You slip your furtive passenger past the Skin-Check Post and the Confirmation of Consolation...
>>>	Description	You slip your furtive passenger past the Skin-Check Post and the Confirmation of Consolation. "Thanks, cap'n," she remarks casually. "Let me teach you a couple of tricks. Just in case you do this again. And here's a little hush-money."
>>>	Name	Muffled oars
>>	Name	Help out an immigrant
>>	Description	Your tomb-colonist passenger yanks off her bandages. She looks remarkably healthy for a tomb-colonist. "I'm not as dead as I look," she confesses. "And I won't get ashore without your help. Yes, the Constables are looking for me back home. Is that a problem?"
>>>	Teaser	Drunk as she is, her skills are formidable...
>>>	Description	Drunk as she is, her skills are formidable. "I was carving men up," she informs you, "when you were still in the cradle." She flips your weapon over the side, embraces you, and staggers off down the gang-plank, gone for good. Your pride is hurt, and your ribs and head ache abominably. All these things are valuable lessons.
>>>	Name	A defeat!
>>>	Teaser	Tomb-colonists have a life-time of bitter experience...
>>>	Description	Tomb-colonists have a life-time of bitter experience. Some of them are the deadliest combatants under the earth. Possibly this one is, when she hasn't drunk quite so much rum. You'll never know. She salutes you, laughing, after you disarm her. "Good fight!" she opines. Then she staggers backwards and falls over the side.\r\n\r\nYou never do find what happened to her. But at least you have her rather magnificent cavalry sabre, and her belongings.
>>>	Name	An effortless defence
>>	Name	One Last Fight

>	Description	The priests gather around the bull, capturing its blood in cups.
>	Name	Apis Temple
>>>	Teaser	The question displeases the priests...
>>>	Description	The question displeases the priests. How ill-omened, even to suggest that the bull might die!\r\n\r\nIf it does die, of course (says one in an aside), there will be another born with the same markings, if not on Visage itself, then somewhere around the Unterzee. Apis is never gone, but sometimes his spirit goes astray. \r\n\r\nTo show you the sort of markings they mean, they lift its tongue, and show you the jewel-coloured scarab on the underside. It looks more like a tattoo than a birthmark.\r\n\r\nThe bull rolls its eyes and pulls its head away.
>>>	Name	Bad question
>>	Name	Ask whether the bull will be all right 
>>	Description	It doesn't look well.
>>>	Teaser	The priests are not impressed with the offer...
>>>	Description	The priests are not impressed with the offer. Moon-Moths are not supposed to partake in commercial or religious endeavours. Besides, it's plain from your offer that you don't understand the requirements for identifying the Apis bull, including the important rule that there can be only one at a time.
>>>	Name	Perhaps not
>>	Name	Offer to sell them a new, undamaged bull
>>	Description	You could arrange an import through the proper contacts.
>>>	Teaser	But they aren't precisely pleased, either...
>>>	Description	But they aren't precisely pleased, either. In fact, they are highly suspicious of why Moon-Moth would want such a thing until you explain that you need it to educate some especially ignorant and impious visitors.\r\n\r\nThen they let you go ahead.
>>>	Name	The priests don't prevent you.
>>	Name	Collect some of the blood for yourself
>>	Description	Perhaps it is a holy relic. Perhaps it could be sold as one to unsuspecting buyers elsewhere.
>>>	Teaser	The tokens are small and not very valuable, as suits your lower rank in the community...
>>>	Description	The tokens are small and not very valuable, as suits your lower rank in the community. The priests arrange them on a table with other small items. \r\n\r\nAs you go out, you pass by the more impressive gifts: drafting tools from the Chief Geometer, scales from Jackal, a heap of foreign coin brought home by Crocodile.
>>>	Name	Impeccable
>>	Name	Leave a respectful token of offering
>>	Description	Even wounded, it remains a god.
>>>	Teaser	The priests would be suspicious of anyone else who did this...
>>>	Description	The priests would be suspicious of anyone else who did this. But you, as Moon-Moth, often have a need to narrate the rituals of Visage to newcomers. The explanations in the Library of Parts are not suitable for strangers, and therefore you are expected to compose your own.
>>>	Name	You alone may act
>>	Name	Observe and make notes
>>	Description	The customs here may be worth reporting later.
>>>	Teaser	You try to bind up the wound, but the bull cannot bear to be touched, and you are forced to give up, as further experiments will end in your being gored as well...
>>>	Description	You try to bind up the wound, but the bull cannot bear to be touched, and you are forced to give up, as further experiments will end in your being gored as well. In any case, veterinary interventions are not a Moth-like function.
>>>	Name	Bellowing and goring
>>>	Teaser	You do the task well...
>>>	Description	You do the task well. The animal stops the most distressing of its noises, and lies down.\r\n\r\nThe priests are suspicious. Medical knowledge is not a part of the etiquette of the Moth. On this one occasion, they are grateful enough not to have you removed, however.
>>>	Name	Out of character, but no one minds
>>	Name	Try to bandage the bull
>>	Description	It is a shame to see it suffering so.

>>>	Description	You approach the Bat. It takes a step sideways away from the cliff edge and cocks its head at you. "Ey there," it says. "You're not me executioner."\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's not your role, then.
>>>	Name	Perhaps not
>>	Name	Push a visiting Bat off the stone chin
>>	Description	The visitor is wearing all black, and keeps reaching up to scratch under its bat-mask. 
>>>	Teaser	You ready your hand to write, but you don't get further than a few exclamatory glyphs before you're interrupted by a Jackal and led away for judgement...
>>>	Description	You ready your hand to write, but you don't get further than a few exclamatory glyphs before you're interrupted by a Jackal and led away for judgement. They don't take kindly to such interventions.\r\n\r\nWhen you recover from the pain they visit on you, you're back where you started. No mask, no costume, no reputation for expertise.
>>>	Name	Caught in the act
>>	Name	Deface the stone with new markings
>>	Description	Imprint yourself on history. [This will get you kicked off the island, in all likelihood.]
>>>	Teaser	You contemplate the Lion for some time...
>>>	Description	You contemplate the Lion for some time. There is an arithmetic sequence to the count of bows that it performs to each feature: the eyes, the nose, each lip. It is hard to know whether Lion is meant to be her worshipper or her lover. Perhaps the two functions are not very distinct.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the Lion's bows are complete, it passes you with a slight snap of its mask-jaws. It was rude of you to stand there watching. The Moth watches visitors. It does not watch citizens. To do so has violated the strictures of both of your roles.
>>>	Name	Service and worship
>>	Name	Silently observe the attitude of the visiting Lion
>>	Description	It is paying obeisance to the face.
>>>	Teaser	The citizens give many meanings to the face: perpetual beauty; stasis; the idea of looking upward into an unyielding darkness...
>>>	Description	The citizens give many meanings to the face: perpetual beauty; stasis; the idea of looking upward into an unyielding darkness. But most of all they speak of the idea of someone above looking down. The face is not convenient to view from down here. It would look its best from the perspective of the ceiling of the Unterzee, beyond reach.
>>>	Name	Flourishing in eternity
>>	Name	Meditate on the meaning of the face
>>	Description	It offers many forms of inspiration.
>>>	Teaser	You climb up along the side of Flourishing's cheek, following a staircase of worn steps...
>>>	Description	You climb up along the side of Flourishing's cheek, following a staircase of worn steps. You don't remember the path being this difficult before.\r\n\r\nThe entry, when you come to it, is plugged with a substance fibrous as spider silk but slick and waxy to the touch. Is this new? Does it grow here? Do they clear it away every year? Is it a form of security?\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't yield to your hand.
>>>	Name	Harder to find
>>	Name	Look for the doorway into the Ear
>>	Description	It must be around here somewhere.
>>>	Teaser	You tell the Frog a partially true story about how this face was carved...
>>>	Description	You tell the Frog a partially true story about how this face was carved. \r\n\r\nIt replies with questions. Detailed, astute, scholarly questions, about who the original people were who inhabited the island and whether the present citizens are their descendants, and, if not, where the original inhabitants might have gone. It hasn't learned the role of stupid credulity at all.\r\n\r\nCaught off guard like this, you have a hard time answering its questions smoothly. You part with irritation on both sides.
>>>	Name	Attended by some awkwardness
>>>	Teaser	You tell the Frog a partially true story about how this face was carved...
>>>	Description	You tell the Frog a partially true story about how this face was carved. The Frog replies with an amplified belch and a story it heard about the sphinxes known as the Salt Lions. It's really a very good Frog.
>>>	Name	Creditable on both sides
>>	Name	Offer instruction to the Frog that found its way up here
>>	Description	That's the sort of thing your Moth would have done to you.
>>>	Teaser	No matter how you hold your head, no matter in what direction you try to read the script, you can't make out the meaning...
>>>	Description	No matter how you hold your head, no matter in what direction you try to read the script, you can't make out the meaning. They're in too old a dialect. Not to mention that the ones near the bottom get smaller and harder to read.
>>>	Name	Old words
>>>	Teaser	The pictures tell a story: this is the face of a woman, Flourishing-of-Years, who once was loved by one of the nobles inhabiting this island...
>>>	Description	The pictures tell a story: this is the face of a woman, Flourishing-of-Years, who once was loved by one of the nobles inhabiting this island. But then she - what's this pictogram? ascended? bloomed? flew away? And consumed with grief he assembled those-who-carve-great-things-from-stone and remade the whole surface of the island.\r\n\r\nThere are several more lines after that, which narrate the cost of the labour contract for the workers, and what was done with all the stone that was carted away, and the compensation given to those who had formerly owned houses on what is now face territory.

>>>	Description	Glossy black fragments gleamed malevolently in the blankness of the ice. You'd swear it oriented them towards you. Some sort of sensory apparatus? Their glassy blackness recalls Mt Nomad, the predatory terrain feature which haunts the blackness of Void's Approach. What is their connection?

>>>	Teaser	You look closer...
>>>	Description	You look closer. For a moment, a solution trembles in the space behind your eyes, and then it collapses into helplessness. The moth is a map of the unconsenting sky. You grope for stars. You find only glimmers. Night floods in.\r\n\r\n"Captain!" your first officer is shouting. "Captain!" You blink. The moth is a smear of darkness on darker water. Nothing remains.
>>>	Name	Ask a question and you will not be answered
>>>	Teaser	As it comes apart, scenes of gardens swim before you...
>>>	Description	As it comes apart, scenes of gardens swim before you. There are other winged things depicted here: butterflies on flowers, alphabet-winged frost-moths, bees alive with red memory. A mountain rises behind them all. Light grows at its core.\r\n\r\n"Captain!" your first officer is shouting. "Captain!" You blink. The moth is a muddy swirl on the waves.

>>>	Description	One of your sailors breaks down. She didn't go to sea to be a pirate! You've betrayed the fellowship of the sea! Your bo'sun is forced to shoot her when she leaps at you. Grim eyes, tightened lips. But here's your hard-won treasure.

>>>	Description	Your prize is never seen again. Well, you set them on a dubious errand, and the sea is wide. Your remaining crew watches you covertly. Are you all pirates now?

>>>	Description	Many boats circle the island, all keeping their distance. The one that gets closest is an extended rowboat painted in yellows, whites and reds. Four servant monkeys strain at the oars, while its true passenger sits in comfort behind a gauze curtain. Just for a moment an eye catches yours, but only for a moment. It would not do for a high-souled ape to see something so beneath its notice.

>>>	Teaser	The trip offers a little time to think on the Penties...
>>>	Description	The trip offers a little time to think on the Penties. Technically, they are monkeys rather than apes, but it is not tactful to remind them of this. To their high-souled faces, the accepted name is 'Pentecost apes'. In private though, 'the b___y monkeys' is about as common. It is, one might say, an <i>ad hominoid</i> insult.

>>>	Description	The Empire of Hands is hardly as old as they pretend, but mimicry and theft infuses their whole culture. If the Penties have come to think that rulers should be buried in ancient temples, then it is ancient temples they will build. It would hardly be the first time their attempts to mirror humanity have entirely missed the point.

>>>	Description	The Admiralty has never stated precisely why it seeks to keep the Empire confined, though most opposition to it fades once said opposers actually encounter a Pentecost ape. They have been easy to corral, however. Though they do not lack wit, there is not an inventive bone in their hairy bodies, and no amount of stolen humanity has taught them the art of creating engines.

>>>	Description	You slip out of your itchy clothes and into the welcoming caress of hot, deep water. The salts and sweats of zailing life melt away as you simply float, bare and free. Above, false-stars glimmer bright enough to be worth wishing on. All around, the glow of the trees casts ambient calm on the silent peace. How long has it been since you had a moment like this? Since London? Longer?

The hot water hugs you tight as you remember her touch, your last words before departing, that half-smile almost but not quite blossoming into completeness.

>>>	Teaser	From here, the lights of home are just a memory...
>>>	Description	From here, the lights of home are just a memory. The zee is blacker, its tales more guarded. It is not enough to simply keep zailing; none who try ever return home. Perhaps that is the price demanded by Salt, as you've overheard the crew darkly murmur when they think no one hears. That doesn't mean that-\r\n\r\nWait! What was that? Sounded like... giggling?
>>>	Name	Out on the edge of civilisation

>>>	Teaser	Their story is yet to be written...
>>>	Description	Their story is yet to be written. Perhaps the zee beckons them as it did you. Perhaps it does not. Salt cannot run in everyone's veins. Will they be the toast of the Singing Mandrake? Run with the scoundrels of the Flit? You cannot be as much of their life as they may or may not wish you to be, but that doesn't mean they-\r\n\r\nWait! What was that? Sounded like... giggling?

Most never come close to fulfilling their ambition, but you... you are different. You know what you want, and with a sturdy crew by your side, you will achieve it.

Time moves differently out here, in the still blackness and changeless light of candles and false-stars. Had you a chance to start over, what would you have done differently?

>>>	Teaser	Now you look carefully, you can see the traps hidden in the forest...
>>>	Description	Now you look carefully, you can see the traps hidden in the forest. All things considered, it is for the best the 'Ghost of the Ash Isthmus' saw you as a playmate instead of an invader. There are reasons both humans and the smarter apes leave her to her own devices.

>>>	Teaser	The two Pentecost apes attack, snarling and hissing...

>>>	Teaser	The apes snarl and leap, ready to rend with tooth and claw...
>>>	Description	The apes snarl and leap, ready to rend with tooth and claw. But something stops them. They fall silent at the sight of the locket hanging from your neck. It is not clear if they desire it, are afraid of it, or are simply confused.\r\n\r\nYou open it, snapping the rust. Inside is a faded picture of a sleeping blonde baby; red ribbon tied around her blanket as tight as she now keeps it around her arm.\r\n\r\nThe larger ape comes close; stares at the photo. The smaller one has to look away. It is said, oft with a scowl, that the Pentecost apes will take anything from the souls they steal. Language. Habits. Gestures. It is rarely considered that, sometimes, they may take the best.\r\n\r\nInside the hut, the Monkey Foundling sleeps soundly, completely unaware of her protectors in the forest.\r\n\r\nIt is time to leave her to her dreams.
>>>	Name	Sometimes the zee gives back

>>>	Name	Spit!
>>>	Teaser	Some are sweet, some are sour...
>>>	Description	Some are sweet, some are sour. None are as tempting as a plate of salted pork with the worms already picked out, but they fill a corner or two perfectly acceptably.

>>>	Teaser	The stench and heat as the gates open are a sucker-punch to your senses...
>>>	Description	The stench and heat as the gates open are a sucker-punch to your senses. Inside, the stagnant air of the windowless wood palace hangs with sweat and tastes of hair.\r\n\r\nEverything is filthy, and every surface used; the apes as likely to swing across the roof as walk the floors. In prized oases of relative calm, the high-souled conduct themselves with the poise of highborn lords and ladies. Around them, their barely uplifted lessers scamper around exhausted, taking orders and cruelties from all who care to dispense them. In the middle are countless more; a sea of apes longing for advancement and fighting for what they have with tooth, claw and low cunning.
>>>	Name	The Wildweald Court
>>	Name	Gain access to the Court

Anything you can tell us?"\r\n\r\nYes, you know the place. The zee is calm there. It's dark, like all the Neath, but there are lights beneath the waves: red and white distractions, to keep you from noticing the explosive mines. Hulls break there.

>>>	Description	This is very obviously the oldest part of the temple, around which all else has grown over time. Ancient tapestries hang from walls decorated with portraits of a single ape, clothed in violet and crowned by the sun. He is the First Emperor, the hundred-souled founder of the Empire of Hands. His authority reaches across time.\r\n\r\n"Not much to look at, is it?" declares the Delightful Adventuress. "They say they buried the old bugger with all of them. A hundred of the finest souls. A <i>heca-tomb</i> if you will." She laughs for a moment at a joke only she and perhaps three others in the Neath would appreciate. "Mark of respect by the primates, you know, to say no one else could do half as much with them."\r\n\r\nHer eyes glint. "Let's <i>do</i> something about that."

>>>	Description	The Delightful Adventuress produces a large ball of yarn. "With all due credit to Theseus," she says, nailing one end into the wall. "I suspect however, we shall not have to worry about a Minotaur lurking in this particular maze. Come on! Such things are hardly a problem for a woman of adventure! This will take but a jiffy."\r\n\r\nShe leads the way with utter confidence, even when it becomes clear she has no idea where she is going. Even when it becomes painfully obvious to all that she is merely turning left at every intersection, confident that eventually this will lead to the exit. The string runs out long before the maze does, yet somehow this does not feel like an insurmountable problem for returning.

>>>	Description	At the bottom of the stairs is a room with a sealed stone door. In front of that stands a pointedly placed plinth holding three thin pillars and some stone discs.\r\n\r\nThe Delightful Adventuress rolls her eyes. "A Trial of the Mind, it appears. How very adorable. It appears that our monkey friends' ancestors have absorbed more than a few souls with a passion for things of the pulp. Oh, well. That should make things interesting."\r\n\r\nShe slaps your shoulder. "Do the honours, <i>kapitano</i>."
>>>	Name	The Antechamber

>>>	Description	Bits of rubble and clockwork fly. The stonework trembles slightly as if about to collapse, but then settles with just the occasional plink-plink of metal and the tinkle of falling shards and gears of all sizes.\r\n\r\n"Well, that is certainly one solution," declares the Delightful Adventuress, unplugging her ears. "I <i>think</i> though, darling, I shall be taking the rest of those. Cannot fault your thinking! But we would rather reach the centre of this quaint little tomb <i>without</i> ourselves becoming buried in it, would we not? Still, splendid resourcefulness. Splendid. Top marks."

>>>	Description	Muscles, human and primate alike, strain as the Delightful Adventuress harries everyone along. Finally, with a crack and a screech of triumph and exhaustion, the doors slide open. Inside is just blackness.\r\n\r\n"There! Now, chop-chop everybody!" declares the Delightful Adventuress, striding into the dark with a personal glim lantern. Behind her, her monkeys collapse to the ground gasping, occasional stolen words and squeals of protest escaping into the air.
>>>	Name	"Right! On the count of three..."
>>	Name	Outside the Vault
>>	Description	The Delightful Adventuress consults papers while her Clay Man Barnabas and a small crew of variably hard-working monkeys try to force open the doors."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you, you're here," she calls. "Do pick up a crowbar, there's a dear. Bit of elbow-grease should do it."
>>>	Teaser	Blast...

>>>	Name	Too far to jump

>>>	Description	There is no handle, and though there is a gap that a crowbar could fit through, the door seems too thick to get any leverage. Scratch marks around the side suggest that more than a few monkeys have tried. Around it are gaping holes where gemstones were once seated.\r\n\r\nYou press a hand to the door, holding a candle to the cracks. Stone. Very thick. Even dynamite is unlikely to make much of a dent without bringing the whole temple down around you. There must be a way to open it though. Why would anyone bother building a door that they never expected anyone to be able to get through?
>>>	Name	There is no obvious method

>>>	Description	It is not the usual rush of red honey, but a slow fizzling sense as it spreads through your mouth. For a moment, you have the sense of your body being too big, your blood pumping wrong. Memories hang at the edge of consciousness; unclear, faded. As you look at the inscriptions though, chaos melts into meaning.
>>>	Name	You place the chip under your tongue

>>>	Teaser	A terrible light, cast from afar...
>>>	Description	A terrible light, cast from afar. A sliver of cosmogone in the darkness; burning cinders ashore the sea of the dead. The apes who are not yet of the Pentecost fear them, but their covetous natures will not be denied. Those who hold them burn harder, yet are cursed with tortured ambition no blood spilling can sate. It is an addictive melancholy. This is the Icterine Age.\r\n\r\nUncounted times hence, he who will be the First Emperor is not yet the First Emperor. It is he who is first blessed to conquer the blue-clad emissaries from the waters of the dead, and drink deep of their stolen lifebreath by cinderlight. So dawns the Cerulean Age.\r\n\r\nThe Pentecost's reach ensorcels the world, shore to shore, and all who are not ape are cast to the dark. The lifebreaths of emissaries from the waters of the dead have birthed the Empire Eternal in blood and light. All forever bask in the glory of the Amaranth Age.

>>>	Teaser	The memories are diluted, largely unspecific...
>>>	Description	The memories are diluted, largely unspecific. But that is not important. What this red honey carries is something far deeper; a connection of souls across centuries. The birth of an Empire in which even the lowest could be uplifted, and sparks of greatness itself passed on. Magnified. Never lost with the passing of flesh.\r\n\r\nThis was the dream of the First Emperor; one of unity and evolution, transcendence and glory. His memory was placed here that all could see their true destiny. Purpose. Instead, it is as if the Emperor himself is receiving a glimpse of the Empire his dream became.\r\n\r\nHis tears run uncontrollably down your cheeks.

It would take someone capable of writing it to even stand a chance of decrypting it - but the age of the inscriptions and lack of anything similar elsewhere in the Empire of Hands suggests it is a long-lost art.

Already you feel their teeth lunging, the venom pounding through your system, the-\r\n\r\nNo. You feel... nothing... except the weight; the cold, dry skins of hundreds of dead snakes surrounding you.\r\n\r\nThe Delightful Adventuress peers down. "Well, that is what happens when one decides to build oneself a fancy-dancy snake pit and neglects to think of a way for the poor darlings to be kept fed, isn't it? Come on then, get up from there!

The Delightful Adventuress seems utterly unconcerned by her own near brush with writhing death.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do pay <i>attention</i>, darling," she sighs, shining her lantern on the snakes. The thousands of snakes. The thousands of venomous snakes. The thousands of... dead, dried-up snakes. "See, this is what happens when one decides to build oneself a snake pit, only to neglect to consider how the poor things will be fed. Seen it a hundred times! Well, perhaps twice."

She fights to recover, but her bare feet slip on the trunk and she falls; falls with a cut-off scream as she disappears into the foul marsh-slime. For a moment there is only silence and a few fading ripples, but then she explodes out; first gasping for air, and then laughing and laughing as she splashes to shore in a noxious splatter of brown and green.\r\n\r\nShe turns and salutes you, white teeth shining under all the muck.

The crew's laughing faces as they see your naked boarding are soon replaced by screwed up noses and a need to be absolutely anywhere else. You are confined to your cabin on pain of mutiny until it has been dealt with; a process of scrubbing and soaping until it is a wonder you have any skin left.\r\n\r\nYour new nickname amongst the crew is... not flattering. No more need be said. On the plus side, your humiliation does serve to raise crew morale for a good while, as well as spawn at least one new legend of a terrible mudbeast known only to those who dare venture this far East.

>>>	Description	A screeching Pentecost ape drops from the branches. The shock on the Monkey Foundling's face makes it clear; this is not part of her little game. Its rage is focused entirely on her, the Ghost of the Ash Isthmus, and the bright soul with which it can uplift itself to glory.\r\n\r\nIt limps from some trap earlier, its fur blood-soaked and glistening. It lunges at the Monkey Foundling, who half rolls, half falls off the stump and yelps as it catches her by the leg. She rolls; shrieks her own howl as she lashes back with a kick that shatters fang and splits its lip. This only further enrages the frothing ape. It strikes!

>>>	Description	You reach for a stone and bring it crashing down on the distracted ape's head. Its skull cracks, dampness spreading. It collapses to the ground, hard.\r\n\r\nIt is not a child's face that looks up at you. Still, you reach a hand down. The Monkey Foundling just stares at it for a moment, something human returning as the adrenaline fades. For a moment it almost looks as though she will take it. But no. She leaps up on her own, bounding away towards the dark safety of her jungle.\r\n\r\nAnd then stops. Hesitates. She looks back, and tilts her head, beckoning you to follow. It is a look that suggests the game is over, but perhaps not yet quite finished.

>>>	Description	The Monkey Foundling strains, her strength nowhere near enough to defeat an ape without a tactical advantage. Her right hand searches blind for something, anything, to use as a weapon. It closes on a rock. With everything her tiny frame has, she drives it into the side of the monkey's head, and again and again until all that remains is shattered skull and mush.\r\n\r\nShe stands. Drops it. Shoots you a look of... disappointment? The bitterest. And she bounds effortlessly up the nearest tree and away.

>>>	Description	The Monkey Foundling herself is nowhere to be seen, but she has left you something. It sits outside the hut, carefully placed by a large happy-face drawn in the black sand. A little prize, for being such a good sport.\r\n\r\nYour <i>clothes</i> however are nowhere to be seen. Of course. As the monkey part of her would no doubt demand, where would the fun be in <i>that</i>?

>>>	Description	The crew reacts with the expected amount of sympathy to your naked return, which is to say exactly none. By the time you board the ship, every last crew-member is on hand to see and cheer, with more than a couple letting off flares as impromptu fireworks. It is many, many days before the needling ceases and you are able to give an order without first scouring it for innuendo.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, it does boost at least the rest of the ship's mood while it lasts, and you have a new treasure for your collection. You have had worse days.

>>>	Description	Here, the trees do not glow. The lights of the false-stars are invisible. You chase the Monkey Foundling, but she is quick and agile and she knows every tree, every rock. Now, she is not playing. Painful stones and thorns zing out of the darkness, leaving sore red welts that stink and make your blood feel thick. By the time you fight your way through, she has... has gone...\r\n\r\nWhy do you feel so sluggish?\r\n\r\nWhy are your legs so...\r\n\r\nBy the time you realise it is something on the thorns, it is too late. You pass out.

>>>	Description	But your arms won't move. You can't move, not much. You are in a quicksand pit; your head alone still in the air. With sufficient time you can work your way out, yes, though it will be slow and unpleasant, but for now...\r\n\r\nThe Monkey Foundling sees you awaken and stops playing her music, the flute going into her little bag. She watches you struggle for a while, but then walks off, out of sight. Only for a moment though, before she returns, casually dangling... a wasps nest? It looks like it.\r\n\r\n"This <i>my</i> island," she hisses. "You not welcome!"\r\n\r\nThe world explodes into stinging, buzzing agony as she pushes it down over your head.

>>>	Description	It is a place that skunks would think twice of entering, if the Empire of Hands had such creatures. The Monkey Foundling of course is unconcerned, as much at home here as high in the branches or running the forest paths. She almost dances, effortlessly, across a thin fallen tree that crosses the mire; surrounded by the foulest, bubbling mud that has ever invaded your nostrils. She balances in the middle, daring you to try to follow.

>>>	Description	The crew is incapable of holding back its glee as you return from the Ash Isthmus with nothing but the dignity your two hands can muster, and a new found understanding of how difficult it is to make even perfunctory clothing out of leaves and vine.\r\n\r\nIf there is a bonus, it is that the smirks and jokes of the next few days do more to take the edge off zailing than a bottle of Morelways' finest. It will be a good while yet though before it is your <i>authority</i> that first springs to mind when they see you giving orders.

>>>	Description	Her grin vanishes as she reaches up to where it used to be, and her eyes well up with disappointed tears. She was only enjoying a little light mischief with the funny captain. She meant no real harm by it all.\r\n\r\nShe blinks. The tears are gone. Very well, her new look says; the look of one used to fending off monkeys after her soul and cannibals wishing a tender meal. If you want to play <i>rough</i>, you shall have your wish.

>>>	Teaser	It is slow, slow going...
>>>	Description	It is slow, slow going. Your muddy feet slide against the thin trunk as it buckles and strains under your weight. Inch by inch, step by step, you slowly make your way across.\r\n\r\nUntil, bored, the Monkey Foundling suddenly jumps up and down, hard. The tree rolls under your feet; your balance fails. You slip, tumble; are embraced by a marsh whose smell will never leave you. You fight to the surface, streaming brown and dripping green, violently coughing up a gagging throatful of the foul slime.\r\n\r\nThe Monkey Foundling sits cross-legged in the safety of the trees, holding her nose as she points and laughs.
>>>	Name	You slowly cross the marsh
>>>	Teaser	It is slow, slow going...
>>>	Description	It is slow, slow going. Your muddy feet slide against it, and the thin trunk barely carrying your weight. Inch by inch, step by step, you slowly make your way without slipping. The Monkey Foundling is visibly disappointed, even trying jumping up and down to shake the tree and make you take a messy tumble. But no. Not today.\r\n\r\nYou cross triumphantly, to her grudging admiration.
>>>	Name	You slowly cross the marsh

>>>	Description	Your feet step into the coiled rope just as the Monkey Foundling cuts loose the counterweight and you feel yourself flying upside down into the trees. Of <i>course</i> she has traps. The wider Empire has no shortage of would-be invaders, man and monkey alike.\r\n\r\nShe sits back and enjoys the show as you flail around trying to get free, before apparently taking pity on you. Pity however, turns out to be casually and without warning cutting through the rope dangling you in the air and sending you falling back with a surprised thump to the muddy forest floor. It knocks the air out of your lungs, but you are otherwise unharmed. She pauses for a moment to make sure, before her grin spreads back again and she races off to continue the game.

Would it be worth pointing out that the Masters of the Bazaar are not the masters of London? No. Definitely not. For a moment they have a focus for their rage, at being trapped and mocked from abroad. One of them even produces a can of fuel, lighting both the bat and a good part of the roof ablaze.\r\n\r\nThe show ends as the fires are extinguished. The beaten, singed monkey from inside the costume is dragged away amidst a cacophony of jeering laughter.

There is no shame in it for the apes, not even the one you catch in the act. It just spits in your face and scampers off making rude gestures. A pair of mandarins shake their heads at their low-souled brethren, for their lack of ambition as much as anything else.

>>>	Description	The Alchemist arranges a set of souls on a shelf. In Fallen London, it is believed that Pentecost apes thirst for any. For the savage unsouled, that is true. Once uplifted however, their attentions soon turn to finding the <i>right</i> souls, both individually and as a mix. There is no greater honour for an Emperor than to be entombed with their souls unreclaimed. It is a declaration that none other could hope to do as much with them.\r\n\r\nOf course, what they see as uplifting could be simple copying, nothing more. To suggest that here however is considered highest heresy, for it implies the Emperor fit to rule on merely <i>his own</i> merits. Unthinkable!

As you watch, the Judge throws not the book at him, but the gavel. And his chair. Then leaps down with a screech and starts tearing at him with his teeth while the monkeys whoop with fevered excitement.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the fight, everyone seems to have lost interest in what the case was about in the first place, and the judge and defendant are last seen hobbling off together. They leave behind a destroyed courtroom, and a thoroughly contented crowd.

Unless! Unless this miserable wretch should have anything to say in his defense, yes?"\r\n\r\nIn this court, sentencing comes first. 'Defence' is merely a chance to whittle it down. Or is, when the guilty's advisor has not just winked at the audience and poured a stealthy sachet of mutersalt into his water...

>>>	Description	The Cartographer painstakingly draws one of the Empire's islands onto a parchment treated to look ancient. He explains his art freely, glad for a moment's recognition. Since the quarantine and trade embargo, the Empire's best way to lure visitors has been to seed the Unterzee with tales of lost treasure. Maps, primarily, just cryptic enough that they feel they have achieved something by their search. Then, while they poke about in the forests, both their souls and ships are- He stops. He's said too much.\r\n\r\nIs there treasure buried though? Oh yes, he almost snaps, continuing to encode a series of directions into a recipe of some sort.

It is the Imperial Cartographer's job to prepare for their success - a task hardly made easier by the regular Alterations of the Unterzee.\r\n\r\nMaps of every configuration are spread out over his walls, in the forlorn hope that their consistencies will provide a measure of clarity. This would be more likely if not for his habit of idly filling gaps by pencilling in variably obscene doodles, on the grounds that his seniors will never be able to call his bluff.

As you watch from the corner, it plunges its head into a large bowl of... oh, how it wishes it was water... until its breath fails, only to be held under until the thrashing ends. Only then is it allowed to slump to the straw; limp, unconscious.\r\n\r\nThe crowd turns to the three mandarins whose decision is final. They turn their backs. The unfortunate ape's carcass is dragged away, as another steps forward to try its luck.

The sound of burning, screaming monkeys will likely haunt the rest of your days, but you escape unharmed and undetected.

"TO THE EVER SHINING LIGHTS OF HOME!"\r\n\r\nA cheer rises as the pirates raise their mugs; drain them dry. But there is something quiet in the silence. They have long decided that what they have done here disqualifies them from ever again walking on Wolfstack Docks, from singing in the Mandrake... and from meeting the eyes of those they loved. It is not fear that keeps them from asking the visiting captain for safe passage back home. It is agreement, unanimous.\r\n\r\nThe Boisterous Pirate slams his hands together in an echoing slap. "AMEN," he declares, as everyone reaches for the meats that have them salivating so.

Once grace is duly spoken, everyone dives into the bounty, snatching up thigh and heart and strips of tender meat dripping in well-crisped fat.\r\n\r\n"NOT WITH YOUR FINGERS, BOY!" the Boisterous Pirate booms at one hungry soul with juice dripping from his lips. "WE ARE HARDLY SAVAGES!"\r\n\r\nHe considers his pirates. "WE ARE <i>HARDLY EVER</i> SAVAGES!" he corrects, exploding with a laugh that threatens to shake the table clear.

The painful part is after the Boisterous Pirate notices.\r\n\r\n"QUITE A TROPHY!" he booms, jabbing it jovially with a finger. "HAVE NO FEAR! HAVE YOU BACK ON YOUR FEET IN A JIFFY, SO WE WILL! GET ME THE IODINE!"\r\n\r\nAs much as you protest, there is no stopping him.

The other cannibals sit with him around a table carefully laden with your choice cuts and offal, prepared with solemn dignity and a few fine spices.\r\n\r\n"JOIN ME," he booms, bringing the other pirates to their feet, mugs overflowing.

Having found what he thought he wanted, his obsession is over and the reward merely a bauble; as diminished by being dragged from desire to reality as the face of an angel in mere paint.\r\n\r\nSadder still is that once you persuade him to give you the map, it takes but a moment to realise his mistake.

How can you find a stone fragment, here under the black water?\r\n\r\nThe Fathomking is leagues away, but he is the lord of all things lost at zee. His directions were preternaturally precise. The eyes and jaws of the eel glimmer brightly through the blackness where it lairs at the foot of another dock-pier. It draws its head back, as if in homage. In its greenish glow, you glimpse a flake of stone carved with letters. You seize it and strike out desperately for the surface.\r\n\r\nYour crew have fires burning on the dock. They strip off your zee-soaked clothing and wrap you, shivering desperately, in warm furs. Your fist is closed tight around the flake of stone: a thread of blood leaks. At last you prise your fingers open. You read the remainder of your father's name, and the words: SERVED THE CHAPEL OF LIGHTS. [The Chapel of Lights is not far to the south. Go there to end this.]
>>>	Name	The Jaws of the Eel

If you need more assistance, ask him."\r\n\r\nWhat did he know? What secret strategies operate here? [You'll need to find the Fathomking's Hold, somewhere in the south of the zee, to learn more.]

>>>	Description	This is the knife that once lay in the heart of your father. When you take it up - gingerly - a dark and shouting joy rushes through you. Your bones tighten, your eyes sharpen, your blood pounds! Your zailors back away as you raise it, growling with feral energy.\r\n\r\nIt fades. You are yourself again, though something remains - something that would devour kings. And this - this pitiable knot of brown bones, picked clean by zee-air and isle-rat - this is your father. Whatever unclean thing he came here for, he failed. Perhaps you can give him peace. [Return to London with your Father's Bones to complete the game.]

The Chandler assures you that you have nothing to worry about, before welcoming in not simply the Page, as agreed, but group of young Pentecost apes hoping to be his latest apprentice.\r\n\r\nWho amongst them knows why ether is involved, he asks, allowing the eldest to do the honours. She looks at you. She looks at the bottle of ether. She looks at the rag. She grins. And she pushes it, bone-dry, into your mouth.\r\n\r\nThe answer, it turns out, involves screaming. Much.\r\n\r\nLater, you awaken under rags, aching, with a strange feeling of loss. It is done. Your mind licks at the strange emptiness as a tongue might a missing tooth.\r\n\r\nThe Chandler of Souls has your payment.

It is not long before you slip peacefully, content, into a sleep deeper than the zee itself.\r\n\r\nToo soon, for it would always have been too soon, you awaken in a bed of silks. It is done.

At least for this quality of soul.\r\n\r\nYou are led into a small room and ordered, not asked, to disrobe. You permit yourself to be bound in a metal contraption only a few sharp edges from being a torture device. Your head is locked forwards, unable to turn to see what is causing the screeching sounds of metal on rust. Something cold pricks your back. An ether-soaked rag is pressed against your mouth.\r\n\r\nLater, you awaken bruised, with a headache and feeling of loss. It is done.

Under its quarantine, residents of the Empire of Hands have no choice but to smuggle themselves any real distance, and that is hardly a journey for a high-souled ape. Do you not agree?\r\n\r\nThe apes prove surprisingly fine company, the wine and opiates flowing free. Souls are not even discussed once, not even when the last guest has gone and it is time for business to be concluded. Your host waits for you to drain your glass of both wine and drugs, catching you easily as you slump in your chair.\r\n\r\nYou awaken on a couch under a blanket, your clothes on a nearby chair - freshly washed, pressed and awaiting your departure. It is done. Your mind licks at the strange emptiness as a tongue might a missing tooth.

By marriage, not by blood; and I doubt you have truly ended her. She is robust. Nevertheless..."\r\n\r\nHe drums his fingers on the rim of his throne-bowl.

Is the Feast truly Fluke-flesh?"\r\n\r\nThe King attempts several times to interrupt the Chef's excited babbling. When he fails, he gestures to his chamberlain.

Behind him, Barnabas gently drops the Delightful Adventuress on her rump, and stands back patiently.\r\n\r\n"Well, I <i>hope</i> you're satisfied," she snaps, tugging at her skirt and trying to fix her hat. "Rest assured that when I return to London, all of Society will know <i>precisely</i> who to shun. Your name will be <i>mud</i>! Lower than the worms! I have friends in the Admiralty! Mr. Wines is a close personal acquaintance! Rest assured, you have not heard the last of this! Good-<i>day</i>!"\r\n\r\nShe storms back to begin packing for the long journey back on the next ship that will take her.

>>>	Description	The flare lights up the entire chamber. Aha! Once again, the monkeys' slack standards serve you well. For though the chamber itself is stone, above you is mere wood - flammable, flammable wood. Barnabas shields you as the flare sets it alight and rains down charcoal and ash, and gives you the help of a boost to climb up and out. It is not an easy descent from the roof, but it is one you have no shortage of incentive to make.\r\n\r\nBack in the Vault, Barnabas continues clearing the blockage, lacking the agility to escape your way.

When she heard the dynamite go off in the spooky old temple of the boring dead monkey, somehow she knew she'd find you close by.\r\n\r\n"Helping!" grins the Monkey Foundling, letting you climb her rope to safety. Barnabas remains behind, too heavy. He continues to dig his way out, rock by rock.

>>>	Description	The Emperor sits on his throne, wrapped in robes of violet and wearing an ornate golden mask. He remains motionless, silent. He could be mistaken for a statue, if not for an almost imperceptible nod to grant his seneschal permission to speak in his name.\r\n\r\nShe approaches, arms folded in the red-trimmed yellow robes of a court mandarin. Her expression is carefully blank; the chestnut hair on her face powdered alabaster white and decorated with exquisite detail in red and black. The rings on her fingers mark her as a ten-souled ape, a status even the Admiralty can respect.\r\n\r\nShe bows before you; a complicated, ritual display of sweeping sleeves that somehow never breaks eye contact. Finished, she waits for your response.

The only thing worse to be caught doing here than supplying them would helping them escape their confinement!\r\n\r\n"Have your people not already caused us enough pain?" she demands. "We starve, and you would prevent us being fed. We thirst to explore, and you cage us like animals. Why? For what fine purpose? What threat are we to you, who happily dine with devils?"\r\n\r\nShe shakes her head, almost with pity. "What could you possibly see in us that shames you so?"

>>>	Description	With a pair of servants to row the boat, she takes you to the Zeppelin site in Port Stanton. It was originally the project of a traveller from afar hoping to travel East, who encountered an... accident. In his plans and engine however, the monkeys saw their opportunity.\r\n\r\n"The Great Exodus will require Supplies and Fuel, of course," explains the Exquisite Seneschal. "We also seek souls to uplift our brethren that they may join the work. You will of course be reasonably compensated for your expenses, and rewarded upon completion."\r\n\r\nShe also hints that there may be faster ways to complete the Zeppelin. To say more though would require a level of trust that you have not yet earned. [Build Status in Court and by supplying the Zeppelin]

My Emperor thanks you for your gift and declares you an honoured guest of this Court for as long as you obey our laws and traditions."\r\n\r\nYou find yourself being led out of the Emperor's presence. "I would add one thing," says the Exquisite Seneschal in a quieter voice. "If it is your beloved Admiralty's deepest wish that we be gone, the Exodus will grant it, just as much as our freedom. A thing to think about, should it be their wrath that concerns."\r\n\r\nShe bows, curtly. "I bid you welcome to the Empire of Hands," she says in her normal tone, as two servants close the door to the Silent Gallery in your face. [Visit the Zeppelin in Port Stanton if you change your mind about assisting the Pentecost apes.]

It will require everything we have, and more. Only if we all pull together, from our highest to our lowest... one united Empire striding forwards in unison, can we prove ourselves worthy of the souls we have claimed."\r\n\r\nShe pauses, gestures to you. "But we would not be here without one human, one with the bravery to stand against the prejudices of their bat-people. By Imperial decree, it shall therefore be our guest's honour to give name to the instrument of our salvation."\r\n\r\nShe turns to you. The monkeys lean in expectantly.

Us poor little primitives, daring to dream ourselves your equals."\r\n\r\nThe Exquisite Seneschal backs away. Her Emperor's tone is caramel laced with glass, fifteen souls united in hate.\r\n\r\n"You wish my favour?" He gestures for a box. "I wish for fire. I wish for flame. I wish for those who have starved us to lie in the streets, their corpses spurned by the rats and the mangiest of your hounds. All this was to come to pass before the voyage. All was planned. But, time."\r\n\r\nThe box is pressed into your hands. "I grant you a chance then, to use as you will. Deliver this. Throw it to the zee. It matters little. If not today, then some generation hence your people shall learn regret for their sins. Let me however travel on the wings of that satisfaction, and you shall stand by me in the Second Empire."\r\n\r\nHe flicks a hand. "Now get out of my sight."

When you wake, later, you will find it already woven.

He actually strokes his moustache with his hook.\r\n\r\nHe retires to his cabin to investigate the serpent-image, but emerges a day later disappointed. "Different geometries," he explains obscurely.

>>>	Description	The serpent is banded black, yellow, red, beautiful as a child's beads. Its fangs sting like snow. It hisses languorously as it drinks your mind, your strength, your wit, your desire, your sight. "So many things to take up the Spire," it breathes, when at last it withdraws. "Now the worst part."\r\n\r\nWhen the worst part is over, you have what you came for. The Parabox. Inside, it is like any other box. You will never know that, for it cannot be opened.

The Gant Pole drew me, and there I died of age and weariness, turning on my back to rot until the hunters found me."\r\n\r\nThe Chelonites have long boasted of how they slew the Glory, but they've claimed the details were lost in antiquity.

>>>	Description	As you pushed through the thickets, you had the sense that you were not moving at all. Your path extended behind you, creeping, reaching for the edge of the wood, like a green shoot probing for the light. There were no green shoots here. Nothing moved. Your path had never touched the wood's edge. You had always been here - you had always been nowhere. But you might still leave whenever you chose. [When Where the Wood Was reaches 7, you'll find what you seek.]
>>>	Name	Thorns
>>>	Teaser	The ground was dry as chalk, but no dust puffed from your footsteps...
>>>	Description	The ground was dry as chalk, but no dust puffed from your footsteps. It lay thick on the earth, on the ruins, on the bark of trees, on the bones, but it clung like lichen.

No one seems to have heard your wild laughter, or if else they were tactful enough to ignore it. Your heart is still pounding, but it will probably stop eventually.

The apple still tastes like something out of any ordinary Surface orchard, but perhaps you should be more cautious next time.

And I replied to myself, perhaps only if my most very favourite captain were to return right now with some of the golden stuff in that captain's 'old. And strike me dead if you didn't appear!

And Storm, he talks to me. The God-in-the-Roof... he's a fearsome old thing. Don't p-p-piss him off, that's my advice. And if you don't want to piss him off, don't piss the Bone Men off.

Yes, yes, it's undignified, although the postmen of London are honourable and tenacious. The package should have found its way back to the Bazaar. But something went wrong." He leans forward. "The package is in Nuncio."\r\n\r\nNuncio! The island where postmen go when they have seen too much. The island of letters not only dead but buried. Nuncio...\r\n\r\n"The Master's ally addressed the package," Huffam adds, "to a 'Mr Voluminous'. But at the wrong door." He is already gathering his manuscripts to go. "Good luck.

Find it, and you will find his resting place."\r\n\r\nHe sips from a tiny cup of freshly brewed coffee. "This is really very good. So I will give you two final pieces of advice. Firstly, beware Mount Nomad. And secondly, the Fathomking has been given authority over all things lost at zee.

I am certain he will know where your father lies." You can hear the smile in her voice. "Find the Assigner, and find your father."\r\n\r\nAs you bid her goodbye, she coughs. You can feel the air tighten; you can sense her attention on you. "One more thing. Your father owed me a debt. I have, you see, an additional interest in the disposition of his bones, and his belongings. I hope you will be frank with me, when you return. Hush. Say nothing now. Think on it."

The smith is a quiet man with a pinched face, who works entirely in heartmetal.\r\n\r\nThe Cannoneer greets him with a yell of delight.

It must descend into the most secret spaces of the Bazaar.\r\n\r\n"Penstock's Wicket," she says. "He has an understanding with the Bazaar.

>>>	Description	Delicate bottles lowered down chimneys on a rope. DO NOT FOLD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE letters curled through a narrow slot. Rattling, groaning crates brought back to the same address every day for twenty-two days running. The windows they pried open, the servants they bribed, the delivery surcharges they paid out of their own salaries just to get rid of one more packet.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to tell which they hate more: the senders of mail, or the recipients.

>>>	Description	The Hairless Postwoman at the end of the bar smiles mirthlessly; or maybe it's just the lack of eyebrows that does it. "Long enough carrying the things around, you get into the habit," she says. \r\n\r\nThen she tells you that if you stay out late enough, you'll see some of the postmen making a procession to the centre of the island, stringing up rats around the statue like Yuletide decorations, in prayer to an ancient deity of this place. \r\n\r\nFrom the coughing and choking elsewhere in the pub, you'd guess this is a story they often tell to newcomers.
>>>	Name	Scarcity is not an issue

>>>	Teaser	"No," she says...
>>>	Description	"No," she says. Curt, not pleased you asked. "Still had eyebrows when I came to Nuncio."\r\n\r\nThe postman at the next bench diverts you, speaks in a low voice. "Lots of people find habits when they can't deliver the post any more. This one has a plucking habit. Best learn not to notice."\r\n\r\nYou glance up. The Hairless Postwoman is still glaring at you.

>>>	Description	Their stories have different beginnings - boredom, frustration, a fellow who was overwhelmed by guilt after a misdelivery - but they always end the same way. Undeliverable letters and parcels accumulating over months and years. Attempts to ignore the undeliverable, to shove it into a desk or carry it in the bottom of the bag. An increasing preoccupation with these items. \r\n\r\nFinally, a decision: to meet the compulsion, to go to Nuncio and be rid at last of the remnants.\r\n\r\nThe postmen do not bring the dead letters to Nuncio. The letters bring the postmen.

Valid stamps. No delivery-failure markings. \r\n\r\nWhen she finally understands, she kisses your cheek. Then she dumps strings of rats and a couple of decks of cards out of her carrier pouch and fills it with the new material. Then she's off to the docks.\r\n\r\n"She'll be back eventually," mutters the old man by the door. Then again, maybe not.

>>>	Description	It gives off a lot of smoke, thanks to how water-logged it is, but the fire is hot and it does catch. Several of the postmen turn around to look at you and one of them is about to ask something-\r\n\r\nBut before the question forms, Blunt Thomas storms in, waving over arms and shouting at you. "Stop, stop stop! You're swamping the reassembly room!"\r\n\r\n \r\nAn hour later you're standing in front of a glass dome in one of the Dead Letter Office's back rooms. In the pure air under the dome, the letters are reassembling themselves, burning in reverse until they are whole again.\r\n\r\n \r\n"You think we didn't try that?" says the postman on shift, staring gloomily at the pile. "It always turns up again. Whatever you do, don't ever bomb the post."

>>>	Description	They're polite, even apologetic, about your request. You're welcome here, and welcome to take shifts at the Dead Letter Office, but you cannot wear the uniform unless you were a postal employee back in Fallen London. Regulations.\r\n\r\nBlunt Thomas lets you have a look at his uniform jacket, at least. Neat stitching, gilded buttons, a thin but dignified circle of braid at the collar.\r\n\r\nInside, a patch that goes over the heart, stitched with six red letters. You can't read it, but it makes your eyes itch and your scalp feel like burning.

"Go down to the shore, collect up a bunch of what's washed there, and you'll feel it soon enough."\r\n\r\n"Saves time for the rest of us," says another voice. Apparently beach-scavenging is a civic duty hereabouts, like working in the Dead Letter Office.

>>>	Description	Some smile and some laugh and some tell filthy tales, but at rest they all return to the same expression, downturned and bitter.

The inside of my mouth tastes like stamp glue."\r\n\r\nBlunt Thomas gives you a bottle of rum and the use of the basement. "No amenities, but I don't fancy cleaning the blood off a better floor."\r\n\r\nThe patient takes off his uniform for the last time, and lies on the cold floor. "No spectators," says the Cladery Heir harshly, and puts you out of the room. She comes out later with a scrap of skin from the patient's chest. The patient follows, whistling a tune from Mahogany Hall.

A tiny golden gear pings out of the machine and lands beside your shoe. "Usually the effect is the same, but blood is such a common ink ingredient that one cannot rely..."\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, he is telling you something very complicated about 'sentiment detection' and passing envelopes across a strip of joy-sensitive alloy, and something to do with a ratchet or sprocket or... no, you're lost.

For a postman, an undeliverable parcel is sticky hands. Bothers you till it's fixed."\r\n\r\n"The longer you serve in the Post Office, the worse it feels.

The repairs are likely to take most of the afternoon. \r\n\r\n"I like to think of myself as being in the Resurrection business," he says, stopping to look at you seriously for a minute.

A single letter, mangled out of recognition, protrudes from the output slot.\r\n\r\nThe Postal Rat is tearing at his fur. "Wax-brain! Clayskull! What have you done?"\r\n\r\nThere's a great deal more commentary on your wits and parentage during the long hours of repair. The letters themselves are so damaged that they can't be read any more: dead again, in short.

>>>	Description	You had expected... a few shelves of supplies? More files of letters, a few years older?\r\n\r\nNo. It is a pit, so deep that lantern light does not show the bottom. A spiral walkway descends along its wall, and that spiral opens wider as it goes, as if you were looking through the narrow end of a very large shell.\r\n\r\nLining this wall are shelves and nooks, unevenly sized. Some are a few inches square and contain single scrolls of papyrus. Others support crates bigger than coffins. They're made of a woody fungus, grown to meet requirements. There are no marks of carpentry or any of the Postal Rat's handiwork.\r\n\r\nThree turns down the spiral and you feel you can't breathe. Time to leave. You can come back later. Maybe.

Before there was a Dead Letter Office, there was someone else, and they built the last layer on top of what was there before, and so on."\r\n\r\nWhen you press him a little further, he says, "I've been down there. Didn't like it much, but I wanted to test my machine. Thought if it could handle some of the very old dead letters, that would be a good sign, you know, evidence the machine was in working order, good strong sorting categories and so forth."\r\n\r\nHe pauses. "There's letters down there that set your hair on fire if you so much as look at them. See the bald patch on my left leg? That wasn't a machine accident, oh no!

>>>	Description	You get further this time. Three twists; six; ten. The cavern is at least a hundred feet wide at this point, and there is no sign of the bottom. The things on the shelves are labelled in languages you can't read. There are rusty iron boxes, wooden planks, clay tablets.\r\n\r\nNow here is a thing you might hope to understand: a packet wrapped in oilskin. Rolls of maps, depicting unfamiliar shorelines. Annotations concerning the creatures of the deep. A mark where the captain drowned his astrolabe (as a sacrifice, or out of fear?). \r\n\r\nCenturies old the message may be, but seafarers have the same needs and the same fears.\r\n\r\nYou pick apart the knot on the captain's diary and spread the pages. A prickling heat sweeps over your scalp. You can't read the words. You can't read the words. You can't read the words. \r\n\r\nWhen you get back upstairs, empty-handed, you remember the story you could not read. There was a field of stars and it was swarming with maggots.

Drawings of a ruined temple, mushrooms growing in the eyes of its sacred statues.\r\n\r\nThese should have been the making of someone's academic career. They were sent to the Dean of Cryptotheology at the university, but not accepted. And the writer? Did she make it home, or did she die at sea?\r\n\r\nNow they're your notes and secrets.

'Do, please, grant me the pleasure of a response this time, so that I may know whether to set your place! If you will not reply, this is positively the last time I will invite you anywhere!'\r\n\r\nAnother glance at the sender and the recipient. Ah. Yes.

You count the turns at first, but the time comes when you can't see the square of light from the door above, and can't mark how far you have come around the spiral. You exhaust one candle after another.\r\n\r\nAt the end you come to a place where the ramp opens onto a bowl-shaped floor. The cavern must be hundreds of feet wide, here. You light your flare, but even that does not show the cavern walls.\r\n\r\nThe floor is carpeted with - at first you think it is gravel, but no, it is broken shards of clay and stone, all scribbled over in words too old to read.\r\n\r\nAt the centre of this space is a needle of deep black rock, glossy as resin, glittering with ice, inscribed with three arcane sigils that hurt to look at. You feel a meaning in their presence: a prohibition, or a commandment. That all things must come to their destined place. That what cannot be delivered immediately must be saved against a future date. That a message that goes unheard is a tragedy.\r\n\r\nThat the signal must be carried, no matter how far, no matter through what darkness, no matter whether the sender still lives nor whether the recipient can even read the language of the writing-\r\n\r\nThe inscription resolves itself and is known to you.\r\nNO WORD LOST.

And the countless individual miscarriages of meaning from one entity to another which have occurred throughout history and are still occurring, to the detriment of the whole universe-\r\n\r\nHe holds up a paw. "Not going to understand it no matter how much you explain," he says. "And I'm glad, as if I did understand I'd be likely to run mad, working where and as I do."\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he adds, "Likely you'll forget. At least, forget some of it. After all you never wore the uniform." Then he points out where your hair has singed at the temples, and gives you an ointment he keeps in a drawer.

>>>	Description	At the outset, you ration the sunlight, letting out only a glimmer at a time. The descent is long and slow.\r\n\r\nFinally you reach the bottom, and throw the box open. The air blazes. The floor is carpeted with shards of clay and stone, a mosaic of tans and reds and glittering obsidian. The ceiling is so far away that you can barely make it out.\r\n\r\nAt the centre of this space is a needle of deep black rock, glossy as resin, glittering with ice, inscribed with three arcane sigils that hurt to look at. It takes the sunlight's glow and blossoms with it: this is something that once knew that light. You feel a meaning in their presence: a prohibition, or a commandment. That all things must come to their destined place. That what cannot be delivered immediately must be saved against a future date. That a message that goes unheard is a tragedy.\r\n\r\nThat the signal must be carried, that the light can traverse any darkness, that all languages can eventually be translated-\r\n\r\nThe inscription resolves itself and is known to you.\r\nNO WORD LOST. \r\n\r\nThe sunlight is spent. The cavern goes black.

>>>	Teaser	Hours pass without anyone turning up to trouble your solitude...
>>>	Description	Hours pass without anyone turning up to trouble your solitude. There's nothing to do other than to read a postal instruction manual.\r\n\r\nYou learn that, on recent stamps, a slight blemish on the Empress's crown marks where the legitimate stamp press was damaged by a Revolutionary bomb. The absence of this blemish indicates forgery and requires that the letter be returned to its sender. \r\n\r\nDelivery of a letter that should not be delivered is a postal misdemeanour punishable by the docking of wages, assuming, of course, that anyone ever finds out about it, which seems exceptionally unlikely.

She wishes to collect a letter on which she refused delivery twenty-two years ago. She has difficulty meeting your eye.\r\n\r\nBut the letter is here, filed in its proper slot. Firm and masculine handwriting, signs of limited education, inexpensive paper. No water damage.\r\n\r\nShe does not read it in front of you. She tucks it into a bag and goes out.

You explore all the possible postures for sitting on the postman's stool.\r\n\r\nWhen your sole customer of the day turns up, it's an Elderly Devil. He describes the parcel he wants, humming all the while. It's sealed with gobs of wax and marked as Contraband. It clinks as you hand it over.\r\n\r\n"By way of thanks," he says, producing a small leather-bound volume from within his double-breasted coat. "Should your shifts here be at all tedious. No, no, I don't need it! I've read it three times on the voyage here."\r\n\r\nYou read three and a half pages before the creeping terror of it forces you to light a second lamp.

You count the turns at first, but the time comes when you can't see the square of light from the door above, and can't mark how far you have come around the spiral.

>>>	Description	The seed propagates alarmingly fast here. Within a few minutes, there are blemmigans scrambling in between bits of shale and over the faces of the scattered correspondence on the shore. They digest stamps, addresses, sealing wax. Where their tentacles pass over an envelope, they leave behind new replacement directions. Deliverable directions. But who knows whether the new addresses are better than the old blurred ones?

>>>	Description	You make your way along the shore with a big sack. Many of the envelopes are too damp to read, their addresses permanently lost. But a surprising number are still legible. There are also parcels. Here and there is a crate, a message in a wine bottle, a sealed cask that has bobbed up out of a shipwreck. \r\n\r\nYour sack ought to get heavy, with all these contents, but it pulls upwards and away, straining inland towards the Dead Letter Office like an unmanageable dog.

Every sodden bit of paper you fling out to sea will come back in a few hours.\r\n\r\nBut for now, you manage to clear a little patch of shore, a few feet on each side. The stones are bare. As they should be.\r\n\r\nYour companion turns his head towards the sound of your work and gives you a little nod.

Designed to run for a year and a day before stopping. Most likely a wedding gift.\r\n\r\nThe winding key is not included. An oversight? Or is this a wedding gift from someone who did not expect the marriage to last?\r\n\r\nWhatever the giver's intention, it hardly matters now. Even without its key, the clock's works and jewels will fetch a nice price.

Paper and layers of wadded cotton fly everywhere.\r\n\r\nWithin is an elegant anniversary clock, designed to run for a year and a day before stopping. It's lovely, with sapphires on the clock face and scintillack-embellished hands.\r\n\r\n"It'll run another day," says your assistant, pointing out some coiled metal as though you could read its meaning. "Then - click. Stops. Can't be rewound. And look down here: inlaid inscription in Nevercold Brass. If you ask me, someone sold their soul to devils, and this clock is to measure how long they get to enjoy... whatever they bought."

If it cannot be delivered, then at least it can be categorised and archived against the day when a recipient arrives - even if it seems that no recipient will ever come, because one can never be quite certain.\r\n\r\nThe tide carries in a fish larger than you, stranding it ashore.

Not the work of some directional current. It's more as though the whole Unterzee were draining into Nuncio.\r\n\r\nExcept, of course, that force did not affect your ship, when you came this way.

A string of painters belonging to the Nocturnal movement pour from visiting ships, determined to capture the ghostly, pastel splendour of the fungal jungle.

>>>	Description	Long months of secrecy, scheming and sabotage culminate in an ignominious - even cursory - transfer of power. Without ceremony or remark, the disgraced Governor and his staff board a tramp steamer. As it chugs out of port, an azure Khanate trimaran slides into its place. \r\n\r\nIn the morning a Taiman flag hangs over the governor's mansion. The White-and-Golds walk the streets of the colony, glancing narrowly left and right. The tea is served without milk, now. The street signs are written in Khaganian characters first, and Roman ones second. The work of the sapphire mines is not interrupted even for a moment, but the tightly nailed boxes that emerge sail north, now, not west.

>>>	Description	The Carnelian colonists always lived in fear of tigers on the streets after dark. Of a crimson, gorging uprising. In fact, the rebellion is practically bloodless. It turns out that if you put someone in a room with a tiger, they will agree to anything.\r\n\r\nYour agents ensure no doors are locked, and that the garrison has rifles and bullets, but no firing pins. Hapless guards flee as the Banded Prince pads into Heartscross House. You watch the Governor sign the colony over to its original inhabitants. The Prince and his confidants are discussing condiments. The Governor's pen trembles.\r\n\r\nThe humans who weren't members of Her Majesty's Foreign Office are permitted to stay. The tigers have grown accustomed to the advantages provided by thumbs and fingers.

A grey smock, speckled with wax. It turns. Is that a mask? No. The opposite. A skinless face. Knotted, palpitating muscles. "Those of you blessed with a pleasing mien should keep your faces beyond arm's length." You step back.

If the creature could stand it would be - what? - eight feet tall? Ten? Exceptional; not monstrous. Its skin is grimy; its hair lank. Above its nose is a swirl of scarred tissue: a single eye, seared closed. "Was this the very gigante blinded by Odysseus?" the Showman wonders. "We cannot say, of course."

This lady defied his prohibition. Behold the result."\r\n\r\nA figure sits on a chair in the middle of the tent. It mumbles a polite, but indistinct, greeting as the audience crowds around the edges. Its dress is faded at collar and cuff, but clean and fitted. The body within is uneven. One shoulder is high, the other low. Its spine bends like a crook. Its face is a knot of bubbled flesh, dark eyes gleaming in the mass. "If you have the gumption, you may touch the lady's face. She is of a scholarly inclination, and will not bite. She has learned her lesson."

Inside, spectators fill chairs before a curtained stage. When there are no more chairs, they stand. Elbows jostle. Necks crane.\r\n\r\n"I confess," the Showman is compelled to explain, "this gentleman is not a native of the Elder Continent. However, as an aficionado of the remarkable, I could not deny him a place in this exhibition. Steel yourselves." \r\n\r\nThe lights come up. My. How peculiar.

The Showman's eyes fill with unsober tears. When you close it, he gives a strangled gasp. He has forgotten what you were discussing. Won't you open the box again? Just for a moment? He asks, he begs.

A hot wax smell pours from the doors and down the street.\r\n\r\n<i>There are so many!</i> the Snuffer must think. <i>Who would miss one?</i> He does not know you are hiding in the confessional.

>	Description	A representative of the College of Mortality arrives a week later, in one of the Presbyterate's notorious living ships. It stains the waters around it red with blood. He is dressed in the best formal Imperial style - shirt and tailcoat unmistakably tailored in London. He is courteous and pleasant and very, very vague. He does condescend to lower his ear to your mouth to listen to what you have to say.

He smiles with real warmth. "Well done," he says. "We recognise your claim." He bows.

>	Description	The first week, a raiding party from the Isle of Cats attacks. Not one survives. You mount gibbets on the beach to display their remains. The second week, you suffer an assault by Unfinished Pirates. You crush them all to rubble. Now you have a rock garden. The third, a Khanate trimaran takes a dislike to your kitchen garden, and shells your cucumbers into paste. You capture it, rename it, make it the second vessel in your navy.

The Modiste fusses over a stretch of exquisite lace, fixing it in in place with a hooked pin thrust through a pinch of convenient flesh.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do stop mewling. If you want something worth sobbing about, you need only <i>ask.</i>" She glances over her shoulder, smiling warmly. "Ah, Captain!

>>>	Description	The Modiste's hands grip the creature's gelatinous mass, squeezing out every drop of ink into a waiting bowl. It is not merely black, the classic black of style and class, but the deep peligin that is blackness beyond the reach of light. This will be an outfit the envy of any in London society, once the fish smell has faded.\r\n\r\n"Should it be cufflinks, or earrings?" the Modiste enquires, toying with the scintillack in the light.

Unfit even for dusters!"\r\n\r\nShe pauses, sensing your presence. In an instant, her smile is back on. She tucks a loose strand of hair back into position. "Ah, Captain. A pleasure as always. I fear you find me in something of a creative... temper."\r\n\r\n"Would you perhaps indulge my little hobby? I have long fancied a little Polythreme élan in my designs. Immortal fashion, ha!"

>>>	Description	The Modiste is face-down on her bunk, but that doesn't prevent her from berating the unlucky crewman pressed into massaging the knots from her back. "The King is a vulgarian of the worst flavour!" she announces. "I bring him the once in a lifetime chance for cultural immortality, and all he can think of is payment. What is- Stop! Enough of this incompetent fingerplay! Get out of my sight before I write down your name."\r\n\r\nShe sits up, scowling. "He wants the Pirate-Poet. Of course he does. Not Unfinished, but not obeying her clay? Such an anomaly, the poor little pebble. Hmm. This may be difficult. She was a dear friend once. She knows better than to let me use that against her."

"She will be difficult to track down. Unless..."\r\n\r\nShe turns back, triumphant. "Captain, to London! There is an ushabti in the Museum of Mistakes that will greatly ease our search. I shall explain everything on arrival." [The rest of this story requires the Pirate-Poet DLC. With it, the ushabti will let you summon the Pirate-Poet's Alcaeus-class vessel to you.

>>>	Description	"...so I was thinking, we really should do this homecoming properly," continues the Modiste, cutting herself a slice of cake sent by one of the Poet's on-board admirers. "We could get rid of that silly hood, perhaps... yes, something in taffeta would be wonderful for turning those crags into curves, don't you think?"\r\n\r\nThe Pirate-Poet growls. She reaches through the cell-bars for the Modiste's neck. Safely out of reach, the Modiste just sighs, picks up her fork. "Well, tut. If you're going to be like that, sweetie, then you simply don't <i>deserve</i> any of this delightful sponge cake."

>>>	Teaser	"Why, Captain, I hope I have not been forgotten...
>>>	Description	"Why, Captain, I hope I have not been forgotten. I had a most delightful little boutique, not too far from the Bazaar. Many Surface commissions, naturally. Once one has sampled the cloths from behind mirrors, it is quite obscene to return to the mundanity of cotton and silk. Velvet, of course, is another matter entirely. Such a fabric!"\r\n\r\nThe Modiste cuts a slice of fruit tart, licks the side of her knife. "Oh, to show you my finest creations. I would dress you in razors and arsenic and the dream-dyes of Parabola. Tsk, forbidden! When my friends and I first set zail as the Set, we knew no such creative cowardice. Blood and ink, my Captain, blood and ink! Great art has always demanded great suffering. We simply recognised that its obligation does not necessarily have to weigh upon the artist."

We zail <i>Irrepressible</i> beneath the waves, free of censors and censure, the muses our compass and guide! Well, when time and tides permit, of course. It has been too long since our last little salon, and the... unpleasantness."\r\n\r\nThe Modiste adjusts the bodice she is sewing, pins it in place. "Ah, but the wonders we once crafted in the waxlight. The Perfidious Composer, every betrayal a new operetta. The Ender of Critics, knives blunt as their wits. The Silent Sculptress, so unjustly exiled when the truth emerged about her torments of clay and bone. Such fine teas she served. Then, yes, there was the Pianolist and our dear, dear Poet too, but-"\r\n\r\nHer finger slips, a drop of blood flowering on white lace. "Blast it," she mutters. "Not even this year's red."

>>>	Description	You smell her perfume just an instant too late. A gloved hand closes over your mouth, stifling your scream as a blade scrapes your bone. Something catches you as you fall to the deck; a softness behind the pain. Your head rests in folds of silk. A cool, tender caress.\r\n\r\n"Ssssh," whispers the Modiste, cradling your head in her lap; tipping it back. Her knife slices playfully across your throat, just enough to leave its mark. "Sleep, my Captain, sleep. We shall play again soon enough, you and I..."

>>>	Description	It takes three crewmen to pull the Pirate-Poet from the zee's clutches, while others mutter about bringing an Unfinished Man... an Unfinished Woman... aboard ship. She just smirks.\r\n\r\nShe carries little on her but the verses of poetry tattooed over every visible inch, and an old sword almost as chipped as she is. Fortunately, her salvaged possessions also include the jangling money-purse on her belt, fat and ready to pay the traditional freedom-price of her current bounty. As much as the crew <i>could</i> subdue her, all are relieved once she is aboard a lifeboat, rowing away through the darkness towards Gaider's Mourn.

>>>	Description	The Pirate-Poet is swallowed by the darkness as the prow light slides away. Clay Men may not need to breathe, but they cannot float. Even their mighty bodies cannot survive forever down in the lonely black depths where there is no hope of rescue. This far from civilised lands, it is unlikely any friendly ships will pass by in time.\r\n\r\nBut that is her concern. Yours is this intriguing crate that some of your more enterprising crew fished out of the water. What could be inside?

"Few earn a second verse."\r\n\r\nAlong with her freedom-price, she presents a gift - a cask of wine, saved from the sinking vessel by her own mighty arms. "They say it is a fine vintage. My men were saving it to toast our victory against you. Perhaps... perhaps you would join me in a drink to them?"

>>>	Description	With business dealt with, the Pirate-Poet joins you and a few select members of the senior crew for a late supper. She treats the assembled audience to BAPTISM OF GLASS, about her first days at zee after years of servitude. By demand, she follows it with shorter works, and REFORGED, a cry for broken chains.\r\n\r\n"In Polythreme we are given our words. We are not allowed to hope they will be kind. In London I learned to write my own, and in that moment, I was free. One day... others of my homeland will read them, and they too will learn. One day, my King's dreams must end."\r\n\r\nDinner follows; hot wine and cold spiced meats. Sailors openly place bets on whether she actually eats. The Pirate-Poet ignores them. Her stoic facade doesn't even quiver until dessert is served. At that, just for a moment, even she cannot hide a slight smile.\r\n\r\n"<i>Sorbet</i>, Captain?" she asks, eye-ridge raised. "Don't make me tell folk you're even softer than they say..."

Your message is received, and her look makes it quite clear that for this, there will be a reckoning. The half-glimpsed smirk as she turns away, though, suggests that it is a challenge she is already looking forward to.

Her story of countless days spent fighting her way through the slime and stench of a zee-beast's stomach. Rescue by slavers, then shovelling coal until opportunity arose to escape... and then? \r\n\r\nThen, there was more. Now, just aching. All over, but mostly... there. Why there, of all places?

Clay and flesh twist, grapple, entwine; an advantage pressed, a counter-attack enthusiastically welcomed. The smell of sweat. The taste of gunpowder. A few stolen minutes behind the Limpet that could never last long enough.\r\n\r\nThe Pirate-Poet pulls her hood back over her bald head. "You have seen more of my poetry than most now. Those... those are verses from another time. I carved them, but it was your city made them part of my clay.

>>>	Description	The Pirate-Poet glares at the Modiste. Her clay muscles are tense, bulging. But just as quickly, the fight drains away. She slumps, wasting no energy on inevitable defeat. For now at least, there is no escape. The Modiste directs the crew to clamp the ship's heaviest irons around her wrists. The Pirate-Poet causes no trouble as she is led to the brig. Her sword is confiscated and placed in storage.

"I will alight at the next port. I will not spend a moment more than I must in this floating temple of barbarism." She whirls, finger jabbing from across the deck. "Carry a knife, Captain.

"I expected no better from you."\r\n\r\nShe draws her sword. A crewman quickly meets its blade. It takes several more minor injuries before the others finally subdue her, but she is outnumbered and has nowhere to go. She accepts her defeat, submitting to the heavy iron shackles.

>>>	Description	The defiant eyes of the crew stare at you as you enter the brig. They shuffle nervously, but still stand firm between you and the Pirate-Poet's cell. How many times have they ventured down here to hear her words of freedom and rebellion?\r\n\r\nOne has been volunteered as spokesman, his voice trembling as he fails to meet your eyes. Still, he forces out the words. "Can't let you do this, Cap'n. We've heard her poems and what she says, what they can do... they're too important. If it was for <i>you</i>, we'd... we'd right understand. But not for her. Not for Frocks."

This..."\r\n\r\nShe bows her head, gesturing to a crewman to retrieve her belongings from storage. "Please. Take my sword. It will serve you well. Practice with it. Master it. Let our next battle be one of legend instead of poetry."\r\n\r\nThe crew escorts her to a lifeboat before you can change your mind. Behind you, the Modiste's angry glower is almost as strong as her perfume. "Captain! You would betray my trust on the eve of my most glorious creation? You... <i>disappoint</i> me. I will endure this floating temple of barbarism not one second longer!"\r\n\r\nShe disembarks in Polythreme, dragging her steamer trunks behind her. The crew, at least, breathes easier.

This is a fitting end. It is more than I once hoped for."\r\n\r\nShe looks back at you. She nods. She closes her eyes as you drive the sword through her chest; the crack of hard clay, an unexpected softness that embraces the blade as it reaches her heart. There is no breath to stop, no blood to drip from the wound. The silence of her death is barely quieter than her final moments.\r\n\r\nWhat remains cannot even be called pottery, for that implies at least a degree of care and craft. The shape which was once the Pirate-Poet suddenly seems little better formed than a bored child's first dabblings, mistakable for a person only in the dimmest light. Poetry crumbles. Already, little is readable.\r\n\r\nYou pull back the sword; its stickiness drying in the sombre air. The Modiste will not be happy about this. If she dares complain though, she is welcome to sweep up.

They take custody of the Pirate-Poet with the expected stoic politeness, binding her limbs and dragging her by the arms to whatever passes for her King's mercy.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, the Modiste returns in possession of a small idol. Those unfortunate enough to pass by her cabin begin complaining of a buzzing in their teeth, a ringing in the ears that never quite goes away.\r\n\r\n For several days she works in secret. The crew savours the peace and quiet. Soon enough though, there is a frantic knock on your cabin door. The Modiste waits impatiently, shaking with sleepless energy, and armed for battle with scissors and measuring tapes.\r\n\r\n"Captain! Divest yourself of those peasant rags at once." She beams. "I have come to make you <i>glorious!</i>"

These are tailored, precisely cut to your every line and curve, and radiate a life that makes all other fabrics seem withered husks. These garments do not hang, they caress; carry the warmth of a lover's arms in a soft bed. And they are strong. Small cuts even heal on their own, leaving only easily plucked fabric scabs.\r\n\r\nThe Modiste glows with pride, with satisfaction. These are just the start, she assures you. Her next should feel much less like wearing a scream.

>>>	Description	The crew steps back, forming a ring around the brig. The Pirate-Poet is released from her cell, given a moment to stretch. She nods her readiness. The battle begins.\r\n\r\nShe fights as she writes; heavy, heartfelt blows that pound deep and true. You fight your best, pit your skill against her strength. It is a fool's errand. Soon enough her heavy arms are wrapped around your throat, choking the life from you. You have no choice but to signal surrender and fall, gasping, at her feet.\r\n\r\nThe Pirate-Poet extends her hand to help you up. "Bring me my sword," she demands. A crewman quickly fetches it from the stores. "You did not have to offer me this chance. I will always be grateful. Please. Accept this. Master it. Make our next battle an epic beyond poetry."\r\n\r\nYou take the sword. The Modiste will not be happy about this when she finds out. Fortunately for you, she will have no shortage of mutinous crew to take it out on once the Pirate-Poet is far away in a lifeboat.

The battle begins.\r\n\r\nShe fights as she writes; heavy, heartfelt blows that pound deep and true. You cannot hope to beat her in a straight battle, and so don't even try. She is not used to such a skilful opponent; one able to roll with the punches, to use her weight and momentum against her - to save the effort until she makes one fatal mistake.\r\n\r\nThe watching crew gasps as she tumbles, falls, ends up flat on her back. They do not dare refuse when you call for your largest gun. With a blunderbuss staring directly into her face, even the Pirate-Poet must yield.

You have betrayers on board, of a Set untimely scattered. We would witness our betrayers taste betrayal. Such exquisite irony! So much to be learned!

Her eyes meet yours at the threshold of the airlock atop the vessel, before the gun in her face forces her to slowly descend the ladder into its depths.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, a grinding sound of pain and cracking bone rises from the zubmarine's belly, suddenly cut off and replaced with... Vivaldi? The high-notes pierce your ears, the low ones dig deep into your gut.\r\n\r\n"Extraction is complete. Nothing of interest remains."\r\n\r\nA smaller airlock opens. Inside, a box.

The high-notes pierce your ears, the low ones dig deep into your bones.\r\n\r\n"Extraction is complete. Nothing of interest remains."\r\n\r\nA smaller airlock opens. Inside, a box. Inside the box... a heart. Moistened, still warm to the touch. Drilled through with holes, like a roll of pianola paper.\r\n\r\nThe <i>Irrepressible</i> submerges. Its ripples soon disappear.

Behind them, the hatch slams shut.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, a grinding sound of pain and cracking bone rises from the zubmarine's belly, suddenly cut off and replaced with... Vivaldi? The high-notes pierce your ears, the low ones dig deep into your gut.\r\n\r\n"Extraction is complete. Nothing of interest remains."\r\n\r\nA smaller airlock opens. Inside, a box.

Blood drips down your sleeve from superficial wounds, easily ignored for now. She doesn't blink as she dabs away a scratch of her own from one exquisite cheek. Again, a clash of weapons!

The things she could do for you with her hammers and chisels. Horns! Fangs! Wings of shimmering bone! Mothers would scare their children to sleep with tales of your face alone." She smirks. "Need I even <i>describe</i> the perfect costume I would design?"\r\n\r\nThe Pirate-Poet gives it some grudging thought.\r\n\r\n"No bl___y arsenic," she grunts. "And no bl___y taffeta."

"Sweetie, what is the purpose of our little Set if not to struggle for Art's own liberation? It is not just our own muses we give flight, but all creations that our humble work makes more palatable to the boorish <i>ignorati</i>."\r\n\r\n"I do not think the rest... see it that way."\r\n\r\n"In their hearts, they do.

"Before my head was always full of words <i>I can never get right!</i>"\r\n\r\n"We call it being an <i>artist</i>, my dear. Is it any wonder so many of us go crackers?"

>>>	Description	After the sacrifice, when the captain's neck has been cleanly severed and their blood pooled on the steps, the pithing process begins. The outer integument is peeled away and their bones, organs, muscles removed. This remnant will be given false life with the glyphs, so that it may wait with a bright sword in the chapel until one day, another sacrifice may come. The old executioner will be retired and given to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe captain's skin will be filled with glory. The attendants will place it in the mould and pour the wax donated by lesser celebrants. The wick will be emplaced, down through the crown of the head to the hollow of the groin. The Priest will recite the lessons once more, and replace the captain's eyes in the skin of the sockets for the living wax to grasp them. The odour of searing will fade. The woman from the Second City will coax the flesh with oils until it resembles life. The glyphs will be imparted and the chest will heave with false breath.\r\n\r\nAt last you will rise and take your name. You will leave the chapel in the shape of the captain, and take your place aboard the captain's ship. No one will ever know. The differences will be invisible. Perhaps one day a sweetheart will trace the scar around your neck and ask laughingly, were you once beheaded? And you will shrug and answer, "Only once."

A chorus of rats begins chanting 'thank you'. You do not keep count, but it seems they intend to go the full distance.\r\n\r\nThe First Minister's gratitude is less symbolic. He gestures, and a cart pulled by both a rat and a cavy wheels in Pigmote's treasure - the Rat Star, the Lady's Eye, the Thalassine... goodness only knows how many other names this glowing scintillack might have.\r\n\r\n"From now on we light our own path," says the First Minister.

I am Edgar, Second Chief Engineer of the Third Rat Brigade. I invite you to avail yourself of food and fuel at our expense; the only cost to you is a choice."\r\n\r\nThe rat stepped back; at precisely the same moment, with what appeared to be the ease of long habit, the guinea pig scuttled forward, and made a declamatory chirp.\r\n\r\n"Welcome, Captain, to the Isle of Cavia.

We came to live as citizens of our own Republic! We came with our tools, our teeth, our clever hands, and we made a beautiful city by the light of the Rat Star that shone bright and blue on Mount Ararat." The Chief Engineer nodded towards the distant hill.\r\n\r\n"One day we braved the depths of the Chickenwoods, and from the top of Mount Ararat we plucked the Rat Star to be our light; our beacon. But the Pigs of Cavy saw the light, and they lusted for it; they sent armies to rule us and steal our Star! We will not permit them to take what is ours! We will resist to our last breath!

We passed through a number of what can only be termed check-points, as fierce-eyed rats shouldered their derringers and saluted the Chief Engineer. Soon we come upon a small colony, smaller than some of the infestations I had encountered in London flats: perhaps only fifty Rattus Faber all together, working diligently to fortify their side of the island.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>The first thing I noticed was a brilliant light, beaming out from a stump of Chickenwood about six feet high; it bathed the whole settlement in a clean blue glow, and was almost too bright to look at. By its light I could see several raised mounds of earth, suggesting shallow tunnels.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>An efficient fishing operation was set up by the water: an albino rat mending nets while others stabbed sharpened sticks into the waves. Further inland was a barracks, where a sergeant barked drills at a small squadron of fighters.</i> \r\n\r\n<i>My arrival drew attention, and several rats paused in their work to look at me curiously.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>"Welcome to Murinia," said the Chief Engineer, voice warm with pride. "It's not much to look at now, but it will be once we've rousted the Cavies. Take a stroll around while I summon the war council."</i>\r\n\r\n<i>With that he vanished into one of the mounds and left me to explore.</i>

The Cavies are bigger and there's more of 'em. We're better with weapons, but haven't got the stuff to make 'em with; most of us came here as stowaways and brought nothing but food, tools, and the fur on our backs. We can fish, and we nibble the Chickenwoods, but we can't make guns out of trees. The Cavies came with their own steamer, and seem to have endless supplies - we raid 'em, sometimes, but there's so few of us, and we can never hold on to territory gained for long. But that's of no consequence - all we want is to be left in peace to build our Republic. And the Rat Star," she added thoughtfully, after a moment. "Of course. We want that too."</i>

But unlike any I'd seen before: blue as a sapphire, but more brilliant. Something about the clarity of its colour was tremendously soothing. The Chief Science Officer tittered with pleasure as I handed her goggles back.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>"Those of us who've been to the Cavy side of the island and lived to tell of it say that there's plenty of glow there, plenty of bright in the water all round, but nothing like this. We took this from the island's centre, Mount Ararat - only it's not a mountain, of course, any more than this is a star! It's hollow - there's sweet water inside, and coral crawling all up the walls of it. But nothing that glows, save this. It's ours now and no one can take it from us!"</i>

I advised them to put everything they had into one desperate assault on the beached ship. Unhappily, they concurred.\r\n\r\nThe sound of gunfire and screams echoed as far away as my ship, where the crew and I sat and watched. Few of the rats that marched forward that day returned to the light of their precious Rat Star. Those that did returned bloody and shaking... yet in triumph.

Their armour and helmets clanked as they purred and chattered amongst themselves.\r\n\r\n"Well well," said the Seneschal, regarding me with what I supposed to be a smile, "a reversal of fortune? How unlikely. I suppose you will have no trouble slitting this savage's throat on our behalf?"\r\n\r\nMy fraction of a moment's hesitation was all the confirmation the Seneschal needed. "See to the ship," she snapped, and half the party scurried to intercept the rats skulking aboard it, screaming war cries that curdled my blood.\r\n\r\n"As for you," said the Seneschal, sweetly, "thank you very kindly for your gift. I assure you it is most graciously received."\r\n\r\nMore swiftly than I would have thought possible, the Seneschal leapt onto the rat I held bound and sank her incisors into its chest. I escaped with my life - but found myself unable to forget how the rat screamed and writhed while the Seneschal raised her face to me again, his liver gleaming obscenely in her mouth.</i>

Soon we had a glorious mud monster to send thrashing through the Chickenwoods towards the Cavies.\r\n\r\nThe distraction worked perfectly; the Cavies diverted their force towards our makeshift beast, leaving the rats with very little opposition as they plundered the grounded ship.\r\n\r\nThey returned triumphant - as did my zailor, laughing, having led the Cavies a merry chase. Within a few hours the rats' diligence had resulted in the building of a remarkable cache of weapons with which they successfully routed their enemy\r\n\r\nThe rats, ever egalitarian, shared their spoils in addition to the promised food and fuel.</i>

A perfect storm of speed, stealth, and strength in arms favoured us; our cannons letting fly a volley of shot onto the beach before the Cavies could scramble onto their grounded ship to man its guns. Screams and squeals filled the air! The enemy fled!\r\n\r\nA damp hush settled over my crew as the smoke cleared to reveal the torn, bloodied bodies of guinea pigs littering the shore.

We passed through a number of raised mounds of earth mixed with fortifying strips of mushroom flesh, which I supposed to be makeshift walls.\r\n\r\nThe settlement was dazzling: this side of the island appeared to be absolutely wreathed in scintillack. The Cavies' dwelling was awash with silver phosphorescence.\r\n\r\nIt was a large colony; most noticeable was the steam-pinnace - the 'Impossible Lamb'? - that had run aground, from which Cavies came and went, bearing supplies. To the right of the ship, farther down the beach, a large group of Cavies lay on bundles of colourful cloth, whining and wailing as if in pain; to the left of the ship was a ramshackle tent of poles and linen in front of which guinea pigs clashed against each other and sharpened their teeth.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the village was a covered dais, veritably festooned with colourful cloth and guarded by well-decorated knights. I suspected this was where King Gracegnaw kept council.\r\n\r\n"Be welcome, Captain, in the Kingdom of Cavia, Capitol of our Isle and Blessed by the light of Our Lady's Eye." The Seneschal spoke solemnly, but with a hint of sadness to her words. "Or so it was, and shall be again. I must speak with our King and prepare your arrival. My Page will show you the area, and bring you in sight of His Splendour in good time. Page!"\r\n\r\nA much smaller guinea pig, its fur braided with a slender strip of Parabola linen, scurried over, and bowed. The Seneschal took her leave.</i>

This Isle was our salvation; the stronger among us made a pilgrimage towards the pool of Our Lady's Light, and then, miracle of miracles, they were cured! They bathed in Her, they drank Her sweet waters, and the strong brought the weak to Her in turn. Soon we were thriving again, bearing our children and raising them to love Our Lady's Eye and see in it our deliverance."\r\n\r\nThe elder looked sorrowfully at the sick under his care.\r\n\r\n"Since the rats stole Her, the sickness has returned. All this light is but a mockery of Hers, and we gain from it no benefit.

But the Zee is black and unkind; we were lost in the dark for weeks, and no one speaks of those terrible times. But out of the darkness came the light of Our Lady's Eye, guiding us here, to our own Isle! In time we will ride the waves again, perhaps, once we have recovered our Eye. Is it not splendid?"\r\n\r\nIt certainly may have been, at one time, but I could see the hull had been severely damaged by the scintillack reef; there was no way the Cavies could hope to repair it themselves.

Ours are the supplies, the knives, the soft-stuffs and the glory. Their teeth are sharp, it is true, while ours ... " The Page hesitated as the Knights glowered at him. "...are sharper! All praise to the Flowers of the House of Cavy!"\r\n\r\nOne Knight preened while another grunted indifference, working a whetstone along its top front teeth. As I watched, a particularly vigorous swipe knocked a whole incisor out of place.

It was easy enough to sneak up on the settlement when the stolen Eye gave off such light and cast such shadows around the shore; even easier to do what needed to be done when the Cavies were rallied by the sight of their treasure.\r\n\r\nWhat follows was a tremendous rout; rats ripped apart, throats and bellies torn open, viscera slickening the sand. The Cavies took losses, too, but soon the Seneschal declared the day won. I was rewarded with a substantial amount of scintillack.\r\n\r\nI saw, to my surprise, that the Cavies had spared a number of the Rats' children, and were rounding them up. I commented favourably on this, praising the Seneschal's high-minded mercy.\r\n\r\nThe Seneschal chittered pleasantly. "My dear Captain. Be assured that we shall treat them very well. But it is hardly mercy that motivates the preservation of an enemy's livestock."\r\n\r\nA small rat wept quietly over a parent's severed torso before being prodded and pressed into a march.</i>

There: a cove thick with Chickenwood, too small and cramped to fear the mooring of a boat. \r\n\r\nMy crew rowed me towards the very knife's edge of shadow cast by the blazing Eye, and I carefully swam the rest. From shore it was an easy enough matter to pick my way towards the settlement - and once I was within twenty feet of the Eye, I sprinted.\r\n\r\nI stumbled, flailing, into the light of the Eye. This was a terrible plan! What possessed me to think running towards the light was a good idea? "Protect the Star!" they shouted as they launched themselves at my legs and arms, sinking their teeth into my flesh.\r\n\r\nIt was all I could do to shake them off in the water as I struck out for my boat, my crew watching in horror as the beasts clustered my limbs like fierce, furry leeches.</i>

The cavies rewarded me suitably on my return.</i>

Perhaps they were only stumbling about in the dark for a light - as the Cavies were themselves, while lost at zee?\r\n\r\nThe Seneschal and the King exchanged a look. The Seneschal murmured something into the King's ear, and he growled deep in his throat.\r\n\r\n"You saw only the frond-tip of our suffering, Captain. The rats must answer for every drop of noble blood spilt, and in kind. We will require a great many hearts and livers to repair the health of our great kingdom.

"We've fought hundreds against them. They're monsters, pure and simple, and the sooner we're rid of them, the better."\r\n\r\nRid of them?

You stand naked, homeless and penniless on the streets of London, and still Mr Sacks demands "MORE."\r\n\r\nYou wake in another cold sweat, clutching at sheets, hearing the reassuring hum of a vessel that remains yours, for now.

The Beast presses a hand to your bare skin; a coldness that drains the heat from your flesh and spirit. Beads of sweat prickle your skin, turning to ice. Your breath no longer hangs in front of you.

You grip tighter, pulling, wrenching, fighting. It tears free from your gums, blood splattering down onto the snow at your feet, nerves shrieking as they taste the chill in the air. You throw the bloody prize at Mr Sacks' feet. It doesn't look down. "MORE," it booms.\r\n\r\nYou wake, a taste of copper in your throat. Your hand goes to your mouth; thankfully, your teeth remain. All that were present when you took to your bed, at least.

The Beast pulls the drawstrings tight. "MORE." it demands. "MORE."\r\n\r\nA knock on the door wakes you. You rise with a fever, head still pounding from a half-remembered drumbeat.

Blood will spill before this voyage is over, but it needn't be yours."\r\n\r\nJervaise produces a small vial. Crystal. The blood is red; redder than normal blood, almost glowing with vitality.

It places it on the ground and adds another on the top. Into this one it presses the teeth and the hair from the small box.\r\n\r\nPotential. Substance. Only one thing needs to be added, as in the tales of the Nomen. The Crimson Beast of Winter waits impatiently for you to provide it.

>>>	Teaser	You nick your hand with a blade and hold it above the frozen mound...
>>>	Description	You nick your hand with a blade and hold it above the frozen mound. A drop wells up and falls. More follow. They fizz in the lacre, which softens and melts into a puddle of snow; a puddle from which a hand emerges. Then a head. Then another hand; stretching as it clambers up from nowhere. The shape of a child; its skin glistening - white snow rippled with red.\r\n\r\nYou reach out a hand; the child grips it with the chill of frostbite. Its legs finally form from the last of the lacre and it falls to its new knees, shivering and looking around in confusion. One of your zailors hurries over with a warm blanket. Another smacks his idiot head.\r\n\r\nMr Sacks stares down at the creature, which shivers and hugs itself. "Inadequate," Sacks says. "Again." Striding to the sealed gate, it rests a gloved hand against it, basking in the chill.\r\n\r\n"The whisper of a place too cold for gods. Refreshing. Dispose of the mongrel as you see fit. Your Service is done. Be gone, before I change my mind." [Something new will shortly appear in your Lodgings]

>>>	Description	You move to cut your hand with your pocketknife, but the vial clutched in your palm keeps the blade safely from your flesh. You tip it carefully, dripping a few drops of the thick blood into the pile. They fizz in the lacre, which softens and melts into a puddle of snow. A hand emerges from it. Then a head. Then another hand; stretching, as it clambers up from nowhere. The twisted face of a gargoyle, rippled with red blood.\r\n\r\nIt screams. The monster throws its head back; blood wells in its hollow eyes, and drips down its half-formed face. The nascent arms explode into wings of shining ice, as sharp as any razor. It bends backwards, new hands clawing at its eyes. Just as abruptly as the scream began, it stops. The shape collapses, melts.\r\n\r\nMr Sacks looks away. "Another failure," it intones, stepping through the pile on its way to the Avid Horizon's sealed gates. It rests a gloved hand against it, basking in the chill. "The whisper of a place too cold for gods. Refreshing. Your Service is done. Be gone, before I change my mind." [Something new will shortly appear in your Lodgings]

The snickering and half-heard whispering suggests neither is quite getting into the spirit of their punishment.\r\n\r\nThis becomes particularly clear when you push open the slightly ajar door, only to be treated to an sudden ice-cold shower from a carefully placed bucket.

"He came from the North, and to the North he will return." (Another reply.) "The North is too cold for gods." ("Too cold for gods," they intone delightedly.)\r\n\r\nFinally, they nod in agreement.

A solitary boot lies on it. \r\n\r\nSinging rises from the Cock and Magpie: raucous, rustic voices accompanied by a jangling piano.

A table creaks beneath a lavish spread: bowls of plump ivory beans and peas as big as bullets. Golden potatoes, crunchy with fat. A vast roasting dish, in which a human carcass - trussed neatly with twine - sizzles in its juices. A Custodial Chef carves it like a Sunday roast. \r\n\r\n"Ah," he says, lifting his knife. "Regrettable timing. Capture them, brothers and sisters. We'll string them in the well, in anticipation of less fortunate times."

The Custodial Chef asks for the peas. \r\n\r\nYou leave on good terms. They are a welcoming folk, the people of Mutton Island. However, they are not discreet.

As you race through the twisting streets, a second troupe of locals descend from the well atop the hill. They are clad in white smocks and carry candles. They catch you in the flank, and you lose a Recalcitrant Lookout.\r\n\r\nYou are at the jetty when your Sprightly Deckhand - whose reputation outweighs his ability - falls to an expertly flung fishing net. The rest of you make it back to your ship and out to zee. You're still catching your breath when you spy an Admiralty frigate making for Quaker's Haven.

Rosy-cheeked villagers, bristling with butcher's knives, puff in pursuit. You see a second group descend from the hilltop well, carrying lit candles and thistle-crowns - but they are too late to cut you off. Scrambling onto your ship, you steam into the broad gloom of the Unterzee. You leave Mutton Island to its ravenous inhabitants.

They drop from low, thatched roofs onto straggling zailors. It is a depleted crew that makes it back to your ship and sets a frantic course into the dark. Less than an hour out, your lookout spies an Admiralty frigate making for Quaker's Haven. Perhaps you weren't the first to escape the island.

Each time, you repulse them, giving worse than you got.\r\n\r\nAs your vessel pulls away from the jetty, your breathless lookout spies an Admiralty frigate making for Quaker's Haven.

>>>	Description	"Enter the cave," said the Smiling Young Man. "Find the pool," said the Distracted Composer. "Drink," said the Lovestruck Princess.\r\n\r\nYou did as they bid. The cave was black as a vicar's cassock. The pool, when you stumbled into it, was cold as old teeth. Cupping your hands, you drank. The water was bitter, washing away the sweetness of the honey. \r\n\r\nYou wake, with a start, in the Once-Great Poet's chambers. Your mouth is full. Snatching an empty wine bottle from beside the chair, you spit a measure of silvery liquid into it. The Cheery Man's medicine. Back to London!

>>>	Teaser	The Smiling Young Man lent you his knife...
>>>	Description	The Smiling Young Man lent you his knife. The sapling's wood was white from bark to core. You sat by the fire and carved, cutting a shaft and a handle. You sanded it smooth with handfuls of the chalky dust that carpeted the forest.\r\n\r\nWhen you stood to leave, your guide did not. "I mean to stay a while. You can find your own way back?" You left him in the company of the Promising Poet, laughing over a poor rhyme.\r\n\r\nYou awake in his lodgings, your hands empty. No cane. But the image of it is clear in your mind, and you know a shop in London where you might buy one just like it.

Here are necessaries for your next excursion. Here are some peculiar fruit, what I do not otherwise know what to do with."\r\n\r\nTwo days later, the rumours race around London: the Cheery Man is dead. Choked on his dinner, they say. It's a surprise then, when you receive an invitation to drink with the Cheery Man at the Medusa's Head.

>	Description	The Dogged Apprentice is straining against the cords holding him flat to the workbench. His wrists are raw and bleeding. The Tobacconist looms over him, sharpening a scalpel. "Excellent. Now that you're here, [q:Addressed As], we can start. I'll just need a donation from the boy, and we'll have the last component. Could you help keep him still?"

>>>	Description	The Dogged Apprentice screws shut his eyes, as the Crotchety Tobacconist outlines the corners of a box onto his flesh. At the Tobacconist's instruction, you firmly place your hands on the corners, holding taut the skin between the lines.\r\n\r\nThe Crotchety Tobacconist swiftly draws his scalpel across the Apprentice's flesh. The blade cuts easily, snagging only once or twice. Whenever it does, the Tobacconist readjusts the edge and gives it a sharp pull, slicing through the obstruction. The Apprentice pleads, but his screams go unheeded. Your hands and the Tobacconist's grow bloody, as you pinch and pull that patch of the Apprentice's flesh. And when the screams become distracting, the Tobacconist blows heavy smoke into his face - the Apprentice's eyes flutter shut. The Tobacconist grins and peels clean the skin he requires.\r\n\r\nAnd as he tends to the wrapping of the cigar, he oversees your preparations of a small tub of water. "We're going to test our beauty there."

>>>	Description	The Crotchety Tobacconist pauses; puts down both cigar and scalpel. He examines your face beatifically. Abruptly he unties the Apprentice, who staggers to collapse onto the floor. You lie down on the workbench and the Tobacconist grasps your hands. "Thank you, [q:Addressed As]... Thank you. I cannot promise this will be quick, or painless; but it serves a most exquisite end. Now, I will have to restrain you. For your own safety, of course."\r\n\r\nFrom this angle, it's hard to see what the Tobacconist is doing: you have to go by sensation. He draws a line across your chest - the scalpel is sharp enough to tickle. Then he pinches and pulls, slices sideways across the fat. As the burning agony becomes unbearable, and your screams distracting, the Tobacconist blows a heavy smoke into your face. The purple lights flare, then go dark.\r\n\r\nYou are still lying on the bench when you wake. Your bonds have been removed and your chest is covered with a thick pinkening gauze. The Tobacconist is off to one side of the room, concentrating on a large tub on the floor.

"If an old man like me goes under the knife," he says, acrid smoke curling from his lips, "then he can't expect to get back up. And besides, only I know <i>exactly</i> what to harvest for this cigar.

Without hesitation, you snatch up the half-made cigar and toss it into the water. The binding breaks apart with the splash, and the filler spreads throughout the water. The Tobacconist drops his scalpel. He grabs at his heart; the fabric bunches in his clawed hand. With wobbling steps, he approaches the tub.

And when you drive the blade straight through its cap, it just shudders and dies. A viscous purple mixes with the red ink. \r\n\r\nThe Tobacconist chuckles and blows a satisfied stream of maple-tasting smoke. "Now, [q:Addressed As]; shall I show you how to carve up the little b____r?"

A floorboard creaks underneath him, and the Blemmigan turns around - the Tobacconist lunges toward it and drives the knife through its cap. He stabs it again and again.\r\n\r\nBy the end, his hands are stained red and purple. "D__n the - this isn't the quality we need," he says and sighs. "Let me be, [q:Addressed As].

Soon only the sharp crack of the hammer rings out. \r\n\r\nWhen they come down, the Apprentice and Tobacconist are covered in a pall of dust. The Apprentice's eyes are blood-shot, and his lashes greyed with powder. He coughs until he retches. The Tobacconist ignores him entirely. "It'll do," he says, grimly. "The flavour isn't what I'd hoped, but it must suffice. It wasn't a complete waste."

The Crotchety Tobacconist grabs a fistful of clay shavings from the shattered left arm. He rubs the clay into a fine powder, sniffs it, and beams. "Oh, this is it exactly!

I'll remove the gallbladder in a moment - the master will be so pleased to have his ingredient!"

"He's not callous enough, my apprentice. And the rat is accustomed to him, besides. Our flavour will suffer for it." He blows black smoke through his nose that wafts to the top of the stairs. It smells of boiled liquorice.

(They no longer produce cigars here.) The Tobacconist is described as a world-renowned figure, respected for his dedication to his craft and the brilliance of his creative vision. (His dedication is well beyond doubt.) The pamphlet boasts that his genius will forever alter the tobacconists' art. (Not implausible.)

He blows a ring before glancing at his Apprentice, sitting in the other corner of the counter. He corrects himself. "Take us?"

The Dogged Apprentice is slower to board; he all but shuffles to you. "The Grand Geode," he whispers, before entering the vessel and leaving Rosegate to the dark.
>>	Name	A last request

He puffs, and spends the next minute coughing into his arm. \r\n\r\nAfter he recovers, he attempts a smile. "Forgive me; I may be the current proprietor of Rosegate, but I'm merely a stand-in. After my patron heard Rosegate had been abandoned, they sent me in to replace the Tobacconist. Though we revoked our support for him, Rosegate is too great an investment to leave to the zee-beasts."

This is the destination she has been seeking all this time, but she did not expect to find the shop without its former proprietor.\r\n\r\n"All the same," she says, straightening her back as she often did in the cells of Dahut. "I have seen worse. You may safely leave me here, [q:Addressed As]. I need a cheroot, and time to consider." \r\n\r\nShe can't reward you, she says.

Their skin is marked in dozens of places with shiny, calcified ovals, around which the skin is reddened. \r\n\r\nYou offer them the Solacefruit, and they receive it reverently. They don't eat it in front of you, but withdraw through a hatch that is usually kept locked. They are gone a long time, and far off you hear a man's deep laughter.

Then it goes to sleep.\r\n\r\n"After relinquishing a regret to Aigul, one needs a good rest," the First Mate says, ushering you out. \r\n\r\nAn hour or two later, the Crocodile comes out again, cheerful and refreshed.

>>>	Description	The crew gather and tell stories of when the <i>Fortas Kettle</i> was still free to roam the sea floor. The Captain was a jolly man, fond of a drink, who laughed at icebergs. The First Mate was everyone's confidante. The two were meant to be married, even, when they got back to London. But Aigul called, imperiously, and the First Mate drove the <i>Kettle</i> full-throttle onto the spines.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal, the First Mate returns from their latest exploration in the engine room.

The First Mate uses some of it to make the Needles, and sells the rest."\r\n\r\nThe Colonist obviously doesn't approve of the First Mate's regret-collection, and clarifies with only a little prompting. "Maybe I'm the wrong person to ask," the Tomb Colonist says. "But there's no need for wearing the scars of other people's wounds, on top of your own."\r\n\r\nAs if summoned, the First Mate comes out of the engine room, fresh-spined.

It is hard to walk in the space, and there is barely room to store anything sizeable. Instead, the room has collected garbage: log books from past voyages, a coffee pot with a broken bottom, a holiday wreath made of bats'-heads, and all the other sorts of things that gather in a long time at Zee.\r\n\r\nWhen you go above, the First Mate has been in the engine room again.

She lived a dusty life, and wondered whether she even had any appetites to satisfy.\r\n\r\nFaintly overlying this is the First Mate's reaction - pity, annoyance, and a tangle of feelings about a different broken relationship, between themselves and the Wounded Captain.

>>>	Description	The First Mate scrubs wet eyes, trying to compose themselves. Finally: "The Captain was hurt when the <i>Kettle</i> went aground. We kept him from the brink of death." (The Captain is still capable of laughter.)\r\n\r\n"It seems every time I return to him, his wound has reopened." (The spines in the First Mate's flesh are a lance in the Captain as well.)\r\n\r\n"If there were anything I could do..." (The First Mate would give up anything for the Captain, except <i>us</i>.)

Almost at once it begins to shrivel and shrink in on itself, its shroomy flesh blackening and then coming away in ragged strips. It cannot take hold in this waste-space.\r\n\r\nBut the sacrifice was not wholly without effect. The First Mate says, later, that Aigul has been made just a little gentler; and when someone communes with the secrets of Aigul, he brings away more discoveries.

>>>	Description	The Wounded Captain's bed is a tangle of blankets and bandages. A tripod of myrrh does not wholly mask the festering scent. But the Captain's eye is bright and his laugh is hearty.\r\n\r\n"I've heard all about you," he says, gesturing for you to sit. "I won't say you've cheered up my First Mate, as we both know that can't be done! But you've come as close as anyone could."\r\n\r\nHe grimaces. "It's about that time," he says.

>>>	Description	This room is blocked by a thick spine at waist level. The spine is purple-black, but the crew have been working at it with planes, grinding away a silvery powder. The powder is collected on mats and sieved into bottles. "Our export," the First Mate explains. "It goes to Station III. But that is not what we've come for."\r\n\r\nThe First Mate touches the spine, and for a time their spirit is absent. Then, from one of their few patches of unmarked skin, they grow a needle-shaped protrusion and snap it free. "A memento of what I saw when my mind was with Aigul."

"I've never shown such restraint myself. Aigul has too strong a hold on me." \r\n\r\nThen, when you think the conversation has closed, the First Mate adds, "You do not ask me about the Captain. Someone must ask about his wound, or he will never be healed."

>>>	Description	Among the discarded residue in the lower decks, you find a long box, almost a coffin. The First Mate looks slightly put out that you discovered it. "You may take it away, if you wish," they say. "It was cargo on a certain Zubmarine, and they left it here because they needed to divest themselves of ballast. It is not dangerous."
>>>	Name	Behind the crates

>>>	Teaser	The man is grim and short-spoken...
>>>	Description	The man is grim and short-spoken. The First Mate takes him below. Attendants set his hand on the bare face of Aigul. He closes his eyes. In time, he whimpers. Now and then he sings snatches of a Drownie tune.\r\n\r\nHe refuses to take a rest, afterwards, but gets back into his Zubmarine and floats off. The First Mate descends to the engine room.

The Tomb Colonist has just come back in with an armload of stolen logbooks when there's the ringing of a bell below.\r\n\r\n"Someone best go see to the Captain," says the old woman.

The Captain's body has been given to the Zee, but things are just as bad as before, or maybe even worse. Now and then someone comes to give a regret to Aigul, and the First Mate makes it into needles right away. Do you want some? By all means! Collect them! Take them away!

>>>	Description	You are welcome at the <i>Fortas Kettle</i>'s table. The First Mate and the Captain sit side by side, and no one rushes off to change bandages. Now and then a pilgrim comes to visit the face of Aigul, but the First Mate does not collect the regret afterward.\r\n\r\n"One day it might be time for us to travel on," says the Captain. "Now that I'm healed. We'd leave the <i>Kettle</i> where it is, of course."

You could go there directly and give whatever message you think best. Or you could send her a dream by way of Irem; you've heard they make dreams there. Or perhaps there is a way by the Isle of Cats, not that that would be an easy or sensible method.

And is it worth the fresh lance in the Captain's thigh, each evening? Isn't it clear how he is wounded? (We have helped them not to understand. It is our gift.)\r\n\r\nWhen this is not enough to move them, you sing a song learned at Dahut: a song about grief and joy, about the expanse of both, about the irrelevance of an individual drop in that Zee. (We have not heard this song before. We do not admire it.)\r\n\r\nSobbing, the First Mate leaves you and descends to the Captain's chambers. They remain there a long time and do not go to the Engine Room. Days later both emerge: the Captain on crutches, but walking, and with the First Mate close behind.

>>>	Description	The Cladery Heir takes the First Mate aside. She is brisk. Visiting the sorrows of Aigul is an indulgence. The Captain is freshly wounded whenever the First Mate embraces a new sorrow. Can they not see this? Do they not understand?\r\n\r\nWhile she speaks, she is sharpening a blade. The First Mate watches but does not forbid her the operation.\r\n\r\nAfterwards both Captain and First Mate keep to their beds, recovering from their assorted wounds. But they do recover. On the third evening, the Captain is able to hobble up to the galley to dine with the crew.

For the first time since leaving Nook, you can feel the pressure of your own blood straining against your skin. Intolerable! Hot! Too hot! Bursting in the air!\r\n\r\n(A fantasy. A future. We will taste this.)\r\n\r\nThe pressure under your skin seeps away like the slow deflating of a balloon. It leaves a hole in your mind, already folding in on itself and becoming impossible to remember.

>>>	Description	Is the harvest worth the fresh lance in the Captain's thigh, each evening? Isn't it clear that he is wounded whenever the First Mate takes a new spine? (We have helped them not to understand. It is our little gift.)\r\n\r\nThe First Mate's scars redden. "I have been selfish," they say. "You are right to point it out."\r\n\r\nThen they lock the Captain's quarters, and they forbid anyone to take him solacefruit broth. They go down to the Engine Room, and return covered in a dozen spines. Then the crew retrieves the Captain's body, wrapped in a bloody sheet.

It is our gift.)\r\n\r\nSobbing, the First Mate leaves you and descends to the Captain's chambers. They remain there a long time and do not go to the Engine Room. Days later both emerge: the Captain on crutches, but walking, with the First Mate beside him.

>>>	Description	He fell behind in his filing, so he burned a stack of Port Reports, and lied when his superior asked where they were.\r\n\r\nThe lie went undetected. The loss of the Reports caused no great trouble. Nonetheless, the regret rankled. (The Brother had learned integrity from schoolboy novels.) \r\n\r\nConfession offered no cure. It would not retrieve the Reports. It would only disappoint the superior and open the whole department to censure. (Sometimes cowardice and common sense lead to the same end.) \r\n\r\nThe Brother's regret caused more trouble than the deed. (We cured him.) Have you undone the cure? (Get out, you've done enough--)

(They gather what we wish to know.)\r\n\r\nHere is the smell of a cloying perfume. A woman left her husband for a scoundrel. (In a few years she was poor and alone.) "He seemed like a good man. How could I have known?" (Of course she knew.) \r\n\r\nHer husband offered to take her back, but she could not endure his forgiveness. (We have his regrets also.)

(After, she was angry at herself anyhow, for having her fears out of order.) She had a new tongue installed in her mouth.

>>	Name	Creating something breathtaking for the luscious flavour
>>	Description	The Crotchety Tobacconist studies the romance's excerpts. They're breathless exclamations, such as one might utter after a vigorous regime of callisthenics. "[q:Addressed As], I need you to make a poem with these phrases. And I need it to be <i>badly</i> written."

>>	Name	Extracting the robust flavour

An Unfinished Clay Man glares from within and growls as you begin removing planks. \r\n\r\nOnce you've opened it halfway, he roars and hurls his weight forward. The wood splinters, the box breaks - and he charges you into a workbench. Though you may have cracked a rib, you and the other two manage to wrestle him down onto the bench and subdue him. "That should have gone better," sneers the Tobacconist, kicking the leg of the bench. "But at least we've got it."

>>>	Description	The Crotchety Tobacconist and his apprentice stand by with chains, as you pry open the crate. An Unfinished Clay Man glares from within and growls as you begin removing planks. \r\n\r\nOnce you've opened it halfway, he roars and hurls his weight forward. The wood splinters, the box breaks - and you sidestep his charge, letting him run directly into the workbench. From there, it's easy to bind him to the table with heavy chains. "Well dodged, [q:Addressed As]. Reminds me of when I was young and spry." His apprentice stifles a giggle.

>>>	Description	The Crotchety Tobacconist scrutinises the literature through his pince-nez. Every page furrows his brow a little more - soon his forehead is filled with ridges and valleys deep enough to hold one of his cigars. "Is this what passes for love these days?" he mutters, extracting passages with a razor. "I've read better on the back of cigar boxes."

>>>	Description	The Crotchety Tobacconist scrutinises the literature through his pince-nez. He carves into pages with a razor and carefully extracts passages of worth. "I tell you," he says between puffs of his cigar, "reading this makes me feel old. Before London fell - I never dreamed of such carnality. Not because I wouldn't desire it, but because I never imagined the... possibilities they explore here. <i>Finely</i> chosen, [q:Addressed As]."

He takes your poem from his pocket and presses it against the glass. The Blemmigan bangs pitifully against the jar's lid. The Tobacconist sighs pink smoke. "Well, it was a worthy attempt. What's wrong with it? How can it not appreciate Tennyson?" He lifts the jar, and holds it tenuously by the lid. "I could smash you against the wall and stomp you into a pulp. But that would spoil our flavour." He sets the Blemmigan down. "On we go then, [q:Addressed As]."

Still, I think it'll do. Probably."

>>>	Description	You set three skulls on the counter: all perfectly formed, grinning reminders of death. The Dogged Apprentice pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs. "This is better in theory than practice, isn't it? I admit, I thought they'd be more horrible. But they're just skulls; and it's not as if I've never seen those before." He shrugs. "We'll make do. Thanks anyway, [q:Addressed As]."
>>>	Teaser	You set three skulls on the counter...
>>>	Description	You set three skulls on the counter. One is missing its jaw and has a few over-long teeth. One is missing a patch of bone in the back, brains either blown out or bashed in.

Now, then - let's see what you've written." He snatches the page away and frowns. "That hurts, [q:Addressed As] - but... it's like a good punch to the eye: it'll knock you down, but you can still hop right up. Nevertheless, I'm sure we can work with this."

"Since you've had a rummage in my head, where no one invited you." \r\n\r\nFrom his jacket pocket, he extracts a journal wrapped in oilcloth. "My sister's private memoir. She said you hadn't been paid. I said we should pay you with this. It's not much, I know, but there's a sordid turn around year three of her marriage."

Your vessel bucks and heaves on the end of the hauling cable, until finally the cable breaks with a noise like cloudless lightning.

>>>	Description	The tow cables go taut and you begin to pull the cannon free. The <i>Irrepressible</i> shudders, as though the the weapon were being wrenched out from deep in the vessel's quick. The irrigo hue fades from the cannon's mouth as soon as it is free of the hull - the weapon itself is no more than a delivery mechanism. But coiled around the gun is the ammunition, stacked in spiral-shaped racks and lustrous with sickly shades of irrigo. With it, your engineer adds a permanent irrigo sheen to your own black powder. The gunners pronounce themselves delighted with your new destructive power. They'll just have to ignore the whispering coming from the powder-store.
>>>	Name	Disarmed and dismembered

>>>	Description	Your crew return uneasy. They met with no resistance, but report the constant sensation of being observed. They tell you of the wondrous riches they saw aboard: gems, carvings, strange devices never seen before - above or below the zee. Yet every loot-sack is empty. Scarcely have you given orders for them to go back and b____y well steal something when, with a surprisingly tuneful roar, the <i>Irrepressible</i> breaks apart, dismantling itself as though by sheer force of will. Skeins of coloured gas and a medley of exquisite jetsam are all that remain.

>>>	Description	It's not often that a boarding party returns better-dressed than when they left. Your crew return with bulging loot-sacks, yards of silk neckwear and an extraordinary array of waistcoats. Some even penetrated into the inner boudoir; one pocketed a pair of eyeball-sized pearls which, she tells you with a wink, she found "on the <i>table de nuit</i>". Among the treasures and drifts of chiffon, you find perhaps the greatest prize of all: yellowing sheaves of zee-shanties of a kind you have never heard before, as bright as pennies and as mad as hunger.

>>>	Description	Of course, there's no way that you could actually <i>hear</i> the shouts. Not through the airlock, the hull, the yards of water. Never mind the crew members who swore that they could hear every shriek and whimper of the divers you sent out into the corpse-water. And besides, from what you saw, there wasn't time for screaming. The dark slick gathered around their diving-suits, enfolding them like a cloak. You glimpsed one terror-contorted face through the glass of their helmet as they were bundled up in darkness, and then it was over. Only a little flotsam remained; the water was clear, as though the Neither had never been.
>>>	Name	The Bends
>>	Name	Send crew into the carrion-slick
>>	Description	The body is liquefying and spreading. Soon it will be nothing but a swirl of shadowed water. If you want to search the remains, you must act now.
>>>	Teaser	Your ship's lamps sparked strange twinkles in the spreading remains of the Neither...
>>>	Description	Your ship's lamps sparked strange twinkles in the spreading remains of the Neither. When you looked closer, within the blackness you could see an unfamiliar sky, grasping trees, the cries of hostile birds. But now only clear water remains. The battle is over, isn't it? Of course. In any case, the thing is dead. Yes. You tear yourself from the porthole.
>>>	Name	Fogged glass
>>>	Teaser	You turn the lamps upon the spreading, undulating blackness of its carcass...
>>>	Description	You turn the lamps upon the spreading, undulating blackness of its carcass. You can hear the telltale sizzling sound through the hull. Something twinkles within the dark window of the Neither as it leaches away. The star-spread of a night sky, interrupted by a canopy of leaves. A far-off jungle; dark fruits and many-fingered figures sway in the trees. You tear yourself from the porthole, and when you look again, it is all gone. Only clear water remains, as through the Neither had never been.
>>>	Name	Strange currents
>>	Name	Continue shining a light upon it
>>	Description	Never trust anything that seems in a hurry to die.

>	Description	Drownies built a copy of London as it never was: a cathedral, and houses, and fields of flowers, all underwater. The water is cool and luminous, and at the same time it is breathable air.
>	Name	Dahut
>>>	Teaser	The Drownies make you welcome...
>>>	Description	The Drownies make you welcome. They do not attack here. They do not even move quickly. They drift and sing and sometimes dance. 
>>>	Name	They call it the City of Peace
>>	Name	Stay a while
>>	Description	Bring the Drownies news of how London is now, and they will allow you to remain here for a time in exchange. [Note that it is easy to gain Terror in Dahut. Be careful.]
>>>	Teaser	Everything is washed in light, though there is no sun...
>>>	Description	Everything is washed in light, though there is no sun. The air-water tastes of strawberries. The dancers are all around you. The pipes and the drum desire you to sing. And coming towards you are three especially tall and lithe Drownies. They are carrying trophies, and a crown of ivy and white berries, and a witty poem in your honour.
>>>	Name	A memory of a memory of the Surface
>>	Name	Consider attending the Midsummer Festival
>>	Description	Beside the Cathedral is a green field, and on the field are dancers and ribbons and cakes with whole fruits baked inside. [There will be a chance to back out if you do not care for the ritual.]
>>>	Teaser	At Midwinter, the inhabitants of Dahut go below to see which prisoners are ready to leave the breathable water...
>>>	Description	At Midwinter, the inhabitants of Dahut go below to see which prisoners are ready to leave the breathable water. They sing songs of failure and disgrace, and then the Drownies accept applications for escape.
>>>	Name	Prisoners remain until they beg to be drowned
>>	Name	Consider attending the Midwinter Emptying of the Prison
>>	Description	The Drownies gather at the iron latticework gate. Will you join them? [There will be a chance to back out if you do not care for the ritual.]

>>	Name	Testing Branch
>>	Description	Reset Dahut
>>>	Teaser	The light fades out of the air, the warmth from the sea...
>>>	Description	The light fades out of the air, the warmth from the sea. You can still breathe, but your lungs ache from the chill of what you are breathing in. It is difficult to see any of the buildings of Dahut in this dimness, but the Cathedral looks like a wrecked hull.
>>>	Name	Crush, bite
>>	Name	Partake of the White Mollyflower
>>	Description	It will free you from any Enthralment to Dahut, though it will not prevent you becoming enthralled again in the future.
>>>	Teaser	You sing, and the Drownies around turn, arrested, to stare at you...
>>>	Description	You sing, and the Drownies around turn, arrested, to stare at you. They do not want to hear this song. The Cathedral beams creak, and you see that the buttresses are also the bones of a wrecked clipper. The Zee-grass ripples, and you see the crabs hiding in it. The water-air shimmers under the weight of the ordinary Zee above. 
>>>	Name	Fill your lungs
>>	Name	Sing a Song of Broken Hulls
>>>	Teaser	You sing, and the Drownies around turn, arrested, to stare at you...
>>>	Description	You sing, and the Drownies around turn, arrested, to stare at you. They do not want to hear this song. The Cathedral beams creak, and you see that the buttresses are also the bones of a wrecked clipper. You recognise names inscribed by the door of the Crypt: an Admiralty woman lost at Zee, a well-known merchant. They are Drownies now, or parents of Drownies.
>>>	Name	Fill your lungs
>>	Description	Reveal this place as it is: a treason against the laws of breathing and swimming. [Gain Clarity.]
>>>	Teaser	Illusion and truth are really two sides of the same thing...
>>>	Description	Illusion and truth are really two sides of the same thing. The Drownies cannot invent anything; they can only suggest new ways to see what is already present. 
>>>	Name	An interplay of opposites
>>	Name	Sing the Drownie Counterpoint Song
>>	Description	It is a song of dark and light, of acclaim and infamy. [This will average your Clarity and Enthralment.]
>>>	Teaser	The Needle brings you the memory of a long-ago theft, an engagement ring stolen from a corpse as it lay in its coffin...
>>>	Description	The Needle brings you the memory of a long-ago theft, an engagement ring stolen from a corpse as it lay in its coffin. Shame and jealousy, set in a dusty parlour. The recollection belongs to a time and place much more real than Dahut.  
>>>	Name	Borrowed regrets
>>	Name	Consume a Needle of Fortas
>>	Description	The point is sharp enough to end dreams. [This will reduce both Enthralment and Clarity.]
>>>	Teaser	What could be more expected, more inevitable, than two such persons as your lovely selves, withdrawing to enjoy one another's company?

>>>	Teaser	The Cathedral is dark, except for candles that do not nearly illuminate its upper reaches...
>>>	Description	The Cathedral is dark, except for candles that do not nearly illuminate its upper reaches. The Drownies gather in the choir stalls to sing. They sing about graves they will never inhabit, about the renown of a good death. The floor is strewn with Drowning-pearls.
>>>	Name	The last of the Festivals
>>	Name	Consider attending the Liturgy of Souls
>>	Description	The Drownies nibble sugar bones and the doors of the Cathedral are opened for the only time in the year. [There will be a chance to back out if you do not care for the ritual.]
>>>	Teaser	Water and air are the same thing here: a betrayal of nature, or a truce between opposites...
>>>	Description	Water and air are the same thing here: a betrayal of nature, or a truce between opposites. Swim up the side of the Cathedral, if you like, and peer in through its rose windows. (You won't be able to make out anything inside.) Breathe deep. Fill your lungs with a substance cooler and more cleansing than ordinary air. Walk in the gardens with the fish around your knees. Do not ask questions about the King of this place: those will go unanswered.
>>>	Name	Dahut, City of Peace
>>	Name	Wander, look, make no commitments
>>	Description	You're only here as a visitor. You don't need a place to stay.
>>>	Teaser	You cannot sing the song as well as its original singer, but it still captivates: the memory of seduction, the willingness to be seduced again, the glory of the Zee and its inhabitants...
>>>	Description	You cannot sing the song as well as its original singer, but it still captivates: the memory of seduction, the willingness to be seduced again, the glory of the Zee and its inhabitants. The air around you seems brighter than ever, the Drownies more beautiful. You fancy that the creatures of the surrounding Zee are gathering at the perimeter of Dahut to look in with wistful desire. In your song there are no pincers, no teeth, no calendars and no clocks.
>>>	Name	Glittering
>>	Name	Sing a Drownie Love-song
>>	Description	Express your longing. [Deepen your Enthralment.]
>>>	Teaser	In a cluttered workshop, the Drownie Couturier copies fashion plates from London for the upper half of the garment...
>>>	Description	In a cluttered workshop, the Drownie Couturier copies fashion plates from London for the upper half of the garment. The set of the sleeves is as good as anything one could find at home. She takes pride in matching the weave of cloth, the buttons, the dyes and trim, so that nothing falls short of the original. As for the lower half, it swirls and floats as Drownie clothes do, though she has to modify her usual pattern in order to make it fit your legs. Not that there is anything wrong with that, she assures you.
>>>	Name	Drownie Couturier
>>	Name	Be fitted for clothes
>>	Description	Your ordinary garments don't fit in with the local style. If you're going to stay, you might as well blend in.
>>>	Teaser	You lift your voice, and the Drownies join in at once, filling the water with the familiar song...
>>>	Description	You lift your voice, and the Drownies join in at once, filling the water with the familiar song. The Cathedral lights from within, casting rose and gold and nile-green beams outwards from its windows. The effect is immediate. Far above, there is a shriek of tearing metal. It begins to rain in Dahut: parts of a metal hull, chunks of engine, the bodies of Khanate sailors. \r\n\r\nThe Drownies receive them with exultation and reverence. They lay the bodies in rows in the graveyard and search the pockets for anything curious.
>>>	Name	Gather, listen
>>	Name	Sing a Drownie Hymn
>>>	Teaser	You lift your voice, and the Drownies join in at once, filling the water with the familiar song...
>>>	Description	You lift your voice, and the Drownies join in at once, filling the water with the familiar song. The Cathedral lights from within, casting rose and gold and nile-green beams outwards from its windows. The effect is immediate. Far above, there is a shriek of tearing metal. It begins to rain in Dahut: parts of a metal hull, chunks of engine, drowned sailors from an Admiralty ship.\r\n\r\nYou are the first to reach one particular item of cargo.
>>>	Name	Gather, listen
>>	Description	It is full of praise and awe. [This will increase both Clarity and Enthralment, and sometimes gain something extra.]
>>>	Teaser	First they pretend not to have heard you speak, then they pretend not to know who you are talking about...
>>>	Description	First they pretend not to have heard you speak, then they pretend not to know who you are talking about. Then they say that she was here, but that she has long since gone, and that of course she was never imprisoned. Then the story is that she was here, and she was imprisoned for trying to steal the mechanisms out of the Cathedral clock. Then it's that she died in the prison and there's no point looking for her now. All of these stories leave a shape in the middle, an outline of the unsaid truth.

>>>	Description	"The weather has been dismal lately. Hardly a single wreck since Saint Aegidius' Day, and then it was only a little yacht with a few sailors aboard. And two of those were able to swim to shore, and didn't come to Dahut at all! We just have to hope for the spell to break."
>>>	Name	Stormless
>>	Name	Ask a Drownie for the latest news of Dahut
>>	Description	The town is thriving and full of events.
>>	Name	The Fair King's Request
>>	Description	He asked you bury your gift of scintillack, to fulfil a rite they hold in Wrack.
>>>	Teaser	From the one seed, many flowers...
>>>	Description	From the one seed, many flowers. They are as blue as Surface seas - as Surface skies! They twinkle like the stars in dreams. You pluck a blossom and enjoy its lush perfume, but leave enough for the patch to replenish.
>>>	Name	A pretty miracle
>>	Name	Inspect a twinkling patch
>>	Description	Something gleams where you planted the Fair King's scintillack.
>>>	Teaser	From the one seed, many flowers...
>>>	Description	From the one seed, many flowers. They are as blue as Surface seas - as Surface skies! They twinkle like the stars in dreams. You pluck a blossom and enjoy its lush perfume. No more will grow, but so it goes. They were beautiful, in their time.
>>>	Name	A pretty miracle
>>	Name	The last of the sapphire blossoms
>>	Description	The patch of gemstone flowers has not replenished, as in the past. If you pick them now, they will not grow again.
>>>	Teaser	The more you look, the more you see that you are perhaps not intended to...
>>>	Description	The more you look, the more you see that you are perhaps not intended to. The Cathedral's crypt is a prison. The graveyard is larger than it looks, and the bones are not all buried. The border between the breathable water and the dangerous water is not marked clearly; some have drowned in crossing over, leaving their possessions scattered on the zeefloor.
>>>	Name	Known Truths
>>>	Teaser	You describe the Cathedral, its buttresses and its smooth-faced saints...
>>>	Description	You describe the Cathedral, its buttresses and its smooth-faced saints. You sketch the seaweed gardens and the fish that graze on them. You mention the clothing of the Drownies that live in this vicinity: clinging at the torso, swirling below the waist - regardless of whether the wearer is male or female. You write down the lyrics of a few of the songs.
>>>	Name	The City of Peace
>>	Name	Assemble a Port Report
>>	Description	Gather information for the Admiralty. [This will always generate a Port Report, but the contents of that report may vary.]
>>>	Teaser	The Blemmigan scampers over the seagrass...
>>>	Description	The Blemmigan scampers over the seagrass. Here and there a little rosebush springs up from its spores, already budding with tiny furled cosmogone flowers. Drownies applaud your impromptu gardening. But a few minutes later, the bushes fade again, not really there at all.
>>>	Name	Propagation of roses
>>>	Teaser	At first the whole island looks hospitable, but if you look more sharply you can see where the rock is stripped bare, and where the fish consume every fragment that drifts in from above...
>>>	Description	At first the whole island looks hospitable, but if you look more sharply you can see where the rock is stripped bare, and where the fish consume every fragment that drifts in from above. Only a few spots are proper homes for your Blemmigan.\r\n\r\nYou set it in its place. It is truly bright and sets off the false colour of the Drownie blossoms and the Drownie fish. The flowers that grow here natively are red and gold and orchid-purple, but they fade to drab if you look at them from the corner of your eye.
>>>	Name	Contrasting hues
>>	Name	Introduce a Blemmigan
>>	Description	Surely it would thrive in these fertile gardens.
>>>	Teaser	It leads down, but it's hard to see where it goes...
>>>	Description	It leads down, but it's hard to see where it goes. There are plaques to past Drownies, but the words do not hold their meaning from one moment to the next. There is a gate of latticed iron, tinged with rust. Beyond the gate, the water is murky and dim.
>>>	Name	The staircase under the Cathedral
>>>	Teaser	If you stand at the bottom of the stairs and listen at the Crypt-gate, you hear sounds that do not come from the dead...
>>>	Description	If you stand at the bottom of the stairs and listen at the Crypt-gate, you hear sounds that do not come from the dead. At one moment they sound like songs, at the next like tears, and then after that like meditation. Some rattle their bars, but most do not. Where would one rather be imprisoned than here in Dahut?
>>>	Name	The staircase under the Cathedral
>>>	Teaser	If you stand at the bottom of the stairs and listen at the Crypt-gate, you hear sounds that do not come from the dead...
>>>	Description	If you stand at the bottom of the stairs and listen at the Crypt-gate, you hear sounds that do not come from the dead. You hear sobbing, and the names of lost sweethearts, and expressions of anger. You hear regrets over decisions taken poorly. Today your fascination with Dahut does not increase.
>>>	Name	The staircase under the Cathedral
>>	Name	Search for the secret places of Dahut
>>	Description	There are other humans here. You have heard voices and seen Zubmarines in dock. But where are the others kept?
>>>	Teaser	There is a rhyme to tell you the safe from the unsafe, but how does it go?
>>>	Description	There is a rhyme to tell you the safe from the unsafe, but how does it go? Eat the fruit, disdain the root? Chewy lump, something-something dump?\r\n\r\nEven if you remembered perfectly, the food defies categorisation. The potato mash enclosed in lemon rind. The cakes that bleed cinnamon syrup in the water-air. The cocoa-dusted crab, which is not the kind of chewy intended by the poem. Probably. But soon you're too full to think about these matters.
>>>	Name	Sated
>>>	Teaser	Cold collations of crab meat and ham...
>>>	Description	Cold collations of crab meat and ham. Fresh rolls that somehow are not soggy underwater. Mushroom cream soups. Liquors that curl up out of the brandy glass, smoke-gold. And what sort of creature lays these eggs? \r\n\r\nAs for the things that might take away your clarity of mind - the effervescent giggling mandrake salad, the lobsters with kitten faces - you pass those dishes on untasted.
>>>	Name	How lovely it is
>>>	Teaser	Ostrich steaks, seared on each side...
>>>	Description	Ostrich steaks, seared on each side. Green herbs. Wedges of fruit that, even on the Surface, would grow far to the south. You have not eaten like this since... have you ever had such a meal? It is enough to drive away many past fancies and disturbing dreams. 
>>>	Name	How lovely it is
>>	Name	Accept a place at the meal
>>	Description	Most of the Drownies' food may be eaten with impunity. You just need to remember which.
>>>	Teaser	If you won't see the glittering lights and the seaweed fields, then in their place are darkness and deep cold...
>>>	Description	If you won't see the glittering lights and the seaweed fields, then in their place are darkness and deep cold. When your courage gives way, the illusion rushes back in.
>>>	Name	Is it safe to see what is truly there?
>>>	Teaser	...
>>>	Description	...and nothing else changes. The current does not shift you. The music does not enchant you. You are an anchor at rest.
>>>	Name	Time passes
>>>	Teaser	With focus and will, you can avoid the allurements of the place...
>>>	Description	With focus and will, you can avoid the allurements of the place. You do not have to smell the lilac in the air-water. You are not required to notice the unveiled limbs of the Drownies. You need not attend the feasts.
>>>	Name	Time passes
>>	Name	Endure
>>	Description	Take in nothing. Do not be enthralled. Do not learn. Resist the enchantment of Dahut.
>>>	Teaser	When you extend your hand to the flames, they grow warmer, but not hot enough to burn or scald...
>>>	Description	When you extend your hand to the flames, they grow warmer, but not hot enough to burn or scald. The sensation is like dipping your hand into a cup of tea. Seeing your experiments, one of the Drownies makes a gesture. Three of them together push you fully into the bonfire. Your hair is crackling, and something like smoke is rising from your clothes, but when you scramble out again you feel whole just as before.
>>>	Name	Flickering
>>>	Teaser	There is a great water-bonfire...
>>>	Description	There is a great water-bonfire. It does not crackle or smoke as a real fire might. But it is bright and hot, and it turns the Unterzee night into a warm bath. The flames ripple up gradually, in majesty, because they are made of water. And when the Drownies see you watching, they catch your hands and pull you towards the dance, into a current you cannot fight.
>>>	Name	Gathering outside the Cathedral
>>>	Teaser	Around the bonfire, the Drownies dance in shoals, all together in one direction, then reversing course at once...
>>>	Description	Around the bonfire, the Drownies dance in shoals, all together in one direction, then reversing course at once. Their hair is gold and green in the firelight. Sometimes a pair will break off and depart into the shadows. \r\n\r\nThe fire may be a phantom, imaginary flames in air fashioned from water. But the mutual affection of the Drownies is not entirely a performance.
>>>	Name	Flags of light
>>	Name	Observe the Bonfire
>>>	Teaser	The bonfire is not a bonfire, but a sulphurous rent in the zee floor...
>>>	Description	The bonfire is not a bonfire, but a sulphurous rent in the zee floor. The dancers are not dancing, but are drifting back and forth, so many corpses in a fickle current. The whole place is a play, a jest for the King of Drownies, a parody of the Surface. 
>>>	Name	Fear it
>>	Description	Mingle among the crowd. Learn from them. See if you can observe without being drawn into the dance.
>>>	Teaser	The log rhapsodises about a visit to Dahut: the foods, the dances, the affection and beauty of the Drownies, the roses that grow to the size of cabbages, the herds of fish...
>>>	Description	The log rhapsodises about a visit to Dahut: the foods, the dances, the affection and beauty of the Drownies, the roses that grow to the size of cabbages, the herds of fish. 'I would have stayed there all my life, except that my First Mate was afraid of the food in that place and refused to eat it. She pressed me again and again to take her somewhere else before she starved. So finally I agreed to take her away to another place, always intending to go back to Dahut... but my Zubmarine being damaged in the voyage, I could not return...'
>>>	Name	Another visitor's tale
>>>	Teaser	The log tells of an alarming stay in Dahut...
>>>	Description	The log tells of an alarming stay in Dahut. Food that looked like fruit but tasted like flesh; the disappearance of several crew members, without leave or explanation; the scent of mildew coming off a bonfire; a creaking noise from the Cathedral roof, and shouts from its Crypt; an obscure Liturgy involving a Bishop Drownie in cream-coloured robes.\r\n\r\nNow you consider it, you have smelled some of these smells, and tasted some of these tastes, even if you dismissed them at the time.
>>>	Name	Another visitor's tale
>>>	Teaser	The log tells of a harrowing stay in Dahut: the writer could not see the enthralling visions of the Cathedral and the rose garden that fascinated all of her shipmates...
>>>	Description	The log tells of a harrowing stay in Dahut: the writer could not see the enthralling visions of the Cathedral and the rose garden that fascinated all of her shipmates. The Drownies dragged her into the Cathedral Crypt and secured her there so that she could tell no one what she saw. There she remained for many months. Now and then new prisoners arrived. Occasionally the Drownies would take a few prisoners out to be turned into Drownies themselves. But she remained, unable to leave, until one of the Drownies took pity on her and left a key in her reach.
>>>	Name	Another visitor's tale
>>	Name	Read an Unread Log entry on Dahut
>>>	Teaser	The log tells of a ship saved by Dahut...
>>>	Description	The log tells of a ship saved by Dahut. The Zubmarine had been attacked and badly damaged; the fuel was nearly gone; they were being followed by something that tapped arrhythmically on their hull. The crew were too terrified to speak. When they emerged into the sunny-seeming gardens of Dahut, and swam to greet their hosts, they thought they had already died. The beast following them could be seen circling the spire of the Cathedral, but the Drownies said it could not trespass on the confines of Dahut and that there was nothing to fear. 
>>>	Name	Another visitor's tale
>>	Description	It might shed some light, or it might not. [The Log's effect on your Clarity and Enthralment is at the whim of fate.]
>>>	Teaser	You ask among the Drownies, but they reply with reassurances and flattery...
>>>	Description	You ask among the Drownies, but they reply with reassurances and flattery. No no, you are the only ones here! Don't worry! You have no competition. No one could be like you. You are special, welcome, adored. If you think you have heard a strange human voice  now and then, it is just a memory from your life before.
>>>	Name	Unanswered questions
>>>	Teaser	There are human voices, sometimes, even if you can't see the people speaking...
>>>	Description	There are human voices, sometimes, even if you can't see the people speaking. There are footmarks on the ground, and disturbed seaweed on the stones, that must have been churned up by an unaccustomed swimmer. The Drownies are in their element here. They do not leave such marks.
>>>	Name	Unmistakable traces
>>	Name	Look for other visitors
>>	Description	Dahut is thriving. Perhaps there are humans here besides you and your crew.
>>>	Teaser	What is below?
>>>	Description	What is below? Why, the Drownies say, It is a Crypt! It is full of monuments to the past, and persons who are no longer able to move around. The ceilings are low and the smell is peculiar, but that only adds to its romance.
>>>	Name	Asking leads to nothing
>>>	Teaser	Through a window in the stone, you once think you see a woman in a plain dress, sitting very upright...
>>>	Description	Through a window in the stone, you once think you see a woman in a plain dress, sitting very upright. When you look again, she is gone. But twice a day, a Drownie goes into the Crypt with a basket of ordinary bread. Twice a day, a Drownie comes out with a slop bucket.
>>>	Name	Attend closely
>>>	Teaser	Through a window in the stone, you see a woman in a plain dress, sitting very upright...
>>>	Description	Through a window in the stone, you see a woman in a plain dress, sitting very upright. Her hair streams around her in the water. She sees you and raises both hands in a peculiar double wave, because, as you see, her wrists are cuffed together. She smiles at you and then the light shifts and you can no longer see into her cell.
>>>	Name	Attend closely
>>	Name	Investigate the Crypt of the great Cathedral
>>	Description	Why isn't it quieter down there? Does it hold more than the dead?
>>>	Teaser	The Drownie in the vicar's collar peers at you...
>>>	Description	The Drownie in the vicar's collar peers at you. "You have been here since Janupril," he says, as though to a young child. "It will soon be the Feast of All Shrieks, and then Saint Aegidius' Day."
>>>	Name	Do not be foolish
>>>	Teaser	Your crew-mates have different ideas from yours...
>>>	Description	Your crew-mates have different ideas from yours. One says it is October, another that you are just coming up on spring. Another points out that the roses are blooming, so it must be summer. But they've been blooming all year long. Haven't they? How long have you been here? 
>>>	Name	It is every season, and none
>>>	Teaser	Before you can investigate, you have to remember that you're underwater, because the illusion is so strong that it is tempting always to walk on the ground...
>>>	Description	Before you can investigate, you have to remember that you're underwater, because the illusion is so strong that it is tempting always to walk on the ground. But you can swim up to the clock face on the Cathedral, close enough to see the tertiary dial. You should bring a good lamp, because even when there is sunlight elsewhere in Dahut, it never illuminates this part of the clock. If you do that, you can see dials that indicate today's dates: one hand pointing to December, one to June, and a stubby shorter hand pointing to the last of October. That hand is growing longer.
>>>	Name	Times and dates
>>	Name	Investigate the Calendar
>>	Description	The dates in Dahut do not progress as they should. The seasons sometimes overlap. Sometimes it is no season at all.
>>>	Teaser	What is below?

>>>	Description	You part on pleasant terms, with kind words on both sides. They give you a necklet of Drowning-pearls, and tell you to return when you have fresh news of London. Meanwhile, you keep a log of what you have learned. Memories of Dahut are said to fade when one leaves.

>>>	Description	You breathe in the stench; hold it in your lungs. There's nothing like the smell of British engineering. Nor like listening to the engine-roar of your own vessel, bought and paid for. The impellers whirr. The pistons race. She's eager for the Wilderness. \r\n\r\nThe Sharp Driver salutes as she enters. "Cargo's loaded." What are you lugging this time? She adjusts her smoked goggles, and fakes a barker's effusive tones: "Murgatroyd's Inestimable Frontier Supplies. Affordable, reliable - a taste of Old London!" You both pull faces.

Dimensions of maddening colour; bright winds that would scour you to dust, blankets of blazing fog as long as continents.\r\n \r\n"That last station master said to expect trouble," she says, removing her goggles. You blink; it's always startling, how blue her eyes are. She rubs her neck, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nHow do you know that gesture? There was another time - another place, before?

She passes you one. The fungal smell hits your nose. You decline. The Driver laughs. \r\n\r\n"Blame the Empress. I hear she's got a taste for them. Wouldn't let the manufacturer stay behind." She sits on a box stamped with the logo of the Murgatroyd Company. "God bless her Enduring Majesty," she proclaims, with another crunch. "Without her we'd just be two girls stuck back down there in the dark and the damp." Overhead, an amber borealis writhes in a sunless sky.

How much longer - wait, was that the letter plate? \r\n\r\nYou throw your sheets off, and run to the door. There! A letter from her - you tear it open.

Now, precisely now, you choose to see things as they are: the strained hope on its still-lovely face; the beetroot, prehensile anatomy below. \r\n\r\nSeeing that you are no longer in thrall, your lover pulls a floating silk across its thighs. "No one has woken in the middle before," it says. And: "It wasn't a lie, but a different seeing." Then it withdraws from you, shaking and unsteady. On a rock it deposits a pile of coral-coloured eggs.

The passion of the moment is supplanted.\r\n\r\nAfter the tempest is past, your lover tells you: what it is like to drown. How it is to feel the lungs fill with water, how startling and painful. What their life was like before. How they yearn for the approval of the Fathomking, and how all of Dahut works to earn his blessing.

'Oh, my beloved has gone to Dahut, and I must rescue her!' If that's what you wanted, you could have just asked, but this way you have an excuse for dallying with a Drownie first. What will you tell her? 'I didn't want to, dearest, and it gave me a shudder to do it, but I had to, just to get you back.'"\r\n\r\nYou open your mouth, but your lover isn't finished. "You people say we're liars and deceivers, but we're only giving a little extra colour to what's already in your mind. You wanted to be here, whatever you tell yourself. And so does she! If someone is in prison in Dahut, it's her own doing. The walls are only there if you have a mind to view them."

"Some people have a hard time seeing the place as you do. A few can't see either the beauty or the truth here, and they struggle. We don't force them to stay, but they aren't able to go."\r\n\r\nWhen you part, your stay in Dahut is at an end, but your lover lets you keep a few sharp memories of the place, as a parting gift. Most people are sent away with nothing.

The shapes in the water aren't even fully visible, but they are not human, and they do not worship you. They are, at best, indifferent.\r\n\r\nTheir dance is sincere in its fashion, however. They celebrate the fruits of the sea. They welcome the newly drowned. They look forward to a day when Dahut is as large and as populous as Paris or London, with streets and streets of wrecked vessels and lost cargoes.

>	Name	Liturgy of Souls
>>>	Teaser	You take your place in the song...
>>>	Description	You take your place in the song. It is easier to understand once you are inside it. The words are clear, and so is the import of the music.\r\n\r\nThe Fathomking is not here. The Fathomking did not grace Dahut with his attendance this time. It has been many Liturgies since he last watched over the Drownies of Dahut from the pool at the front of the Cathedral. They have done their best to entice him, collecting objects and people and remains of eminent beings. But he remains in his Hold. This is why they are so anxious, why their feasts are not sustaining. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, it is still the Liturgy of Souls. Like the Drownies, you descend into the square pool and bow your head before the Bishop. The Cathedral bells strike the time: midsummer, midwinter, equinox. For the length of the triple peal, you are aware of every past extreme simultaneously: the moments of greatest courage, doubt, longing, fury, pain.\r\n\r\n"It's all true," says the Bishop. Then he slaps you hard on the cheek and pulls you out of the pool. Your body feels differently weighted, but unharmed. Possibly even better than it did before.

You come to yourself with the procession filing out, but you remember one large secret and several obscure hints.

There is a Hymn, and the Drownie comes away altered.

The guards fumbling at the keys cannot open her cell door fast enough to follow.\r\n \r\nThe Drownies are less angry than you might have expected, but they evict you from the rest of the festival. There is no place for you here. They have other drownings to perform.\r\n\r\nWhen you reach your ship again, you find the Lady hiding in the rocks nearby. "I was on my way to Rosegate," she says. "I beg you'll give me passage. Did my composer friend send you? I thought I recognised the tune. He always said he had a song in mind that could have gotten us both out of there, if only he could concentrate long enough. It was good of him to send you, though... oh dear. I'm not in love with him. Do you think that's what he was after? I just want to finish the voyage I was on... Forgive me! I don't usually talk so much, but it has been a long silence in that prison."

The Drownies invited her to a feast. When they applauded her composition, she became savage, and now she lies on an iron bed with her face to the wall.

He comes out and stands meekly at your side, head bowed and wrists together, and very stooped. "Thank you," he says, in a low raspy voice. "You're very kind. I'd much rather be in your brig than here. I can't thank you enough."

As for security, no one seems to have gone to a very great effort. Chains and shackles hang from the wall here and there, but no one is using them. \r\n\r\n"You see how it is," says the Drownie escorting you. "Some of them are extraordinary specimens, but they don't care for what Dahut can show them."

As for the inhabitants who are sharp throughout their full bodies, they don't circulate much. There is said to be a cavern, broad and shallow-floored, where the perfectly sharp grow old together. They aren't capable of anyone else's company any more — at least, that's what you're told, and you can hardly go and ask. At any rate they are more like growing crystals than like people, slowly expanding and bonding with the rock.

They sort themselves by sharpness, too: the sharp-handed cluster with others of their kind, ignoring the keen-footed and the brittle-waisted.\r\n\r\nTo progress through Anthe is to take on more and more of these attributes, to enter the deeper chambers restricted by sharp-style.

Her courage kept me sane as well. Perhaps you've wondered how I came to escape without her."\r\n\r\nHe continues without meeting your eye. "The Drownies kept me a long time, hoping I would choose to drown as well. When they saw that I was not bending, they offered me freedom if I would compose a special song for them. One that would sound less alien to human ears than Drownie music, but that would... create a longing for the cold and dark of the deep Zee. I did this, and they set me free.\r\n\r\n"But since writing the song, I have not wanted to leave the Zee-floor. I have family in London, but it seems so far away, so loud and brightly lit... Better to stay here, where there is nothing to jangle up the melodies I am hearing in my mind."

>>>	Description	You scratch the palm of your hand, and a streak of blood swells up. You squeeze it onto the lump of flesh you're working on. There - a scarlet mark runs between Temtum's 'eyes'. \r\n\r\nOthers around you are more generous, slicing deep into their fingers then daubing the blood onto their offerings with tenderness. Their expressions are beatific. Others force a smile, chew at their nails, and spit the pieces into their offerings
>>>	Name	Hair, or a nail, or blood, or tears

>>>	Description	They name their offerings in turn. A Thousand Helping Fingers for my Neighbour; The Miracle that Brought Me Here; Deportment.\r\n\r\nYou show the dwellers of Hideaway your offering. It was difficult with the limited materials, but you've managed to give the lump of meat and guts a passing resemblance to the shape of Temtum. They seem pleased, but more impressed by your skill with their sign language - you manage to convey that Temtum is important even to you, a stranger.\r\n\r\nYour offering is the last to go down the offering chute. The Suggester gestures their wish for the good health of all, Temtum most especially. The people of Hideaway take this as their cue and depart.

>>>	Description	As the procession marches to the chute, you turn and walk back to your zubmarine. Someone taps you on the shoulder. The Near-Forgotten Betrayer, cradling a bloodied, child-sized Temtum meat-doll, speaks in over-enunciated English: "Do you not know?  It is time to give Temtum your offering." Perhaps she thinks you did not understand the gestured instructions. You only nod and continue on your way.
>>	Name	Take your offering with you
>>	Description	You poured your blood and artistic skill into this. You could probably get a tidy sum for it elsewhere. Why not keep it?

>	Description	Banquet tables are laid throughout the festival square. The smell would have a lesser zailor heave out their innards, and all of the lurid dye in the world does not disguise how unappetising the meat is. Nevertheless, some diners rush eagerly to their seats.

>>>	Teaser	You fill your mouth with the foul, dyed water...
>>>	Description	You fill your mouth with the foul, dyed water. Your fellow diners spit it out in a spray; you follow suit. When the rainbow clears, the tables - not to mention you and your fellow diners - are covered in colour. The green-lipped Philosopher holds her stomach but forces a smile; the Mercenary grins at everyone down the table, showing off his indigo stained teeth.
>>	Name	Participate in the Ceremony of Seven Sips
>>	Description	A chalice of an inky blue liquid is set before you. To your left, the Sallow Philosopher has a green drink; to your right, the Conscientious Mercenary is sipping something indigo.

>>>	Description	You carve into your dinner: a fish, whose identifying traits have been lost to the layers of pigment caked onto it. As you carve off a bite, its mouth flaps open. Cosmogone dye trickles out. It might be tasty, if the meat weren't as chewy as gum, and if you couldn't feel the dyes colouring your intestines; hopefully you're fond of blue. 
>>	Name	Consume the Abyssal Bounty
>>	Description	A bell rings. The Conscientious Mercenary licks his lips and begins carving a squelching, squirming fish. The Sallow Philosopher performs the gesture of good digestion, before forcing down a bite.

>>>	Description	The Conscientious Mercenary looks at you meaningfully and cups his cheeks: the gesture of plenty. He slices you a lobe of the shark's brain, and licks the violant jelly from the blade when done. He considers the eyes carefully, before he places one on your plate. He adjusts it to look up at you.\r\n\r\nYour first bite of the brain, and the taste spreads through your mouth like ivy. The eye is no better. It pops in your mouth, bursting into stinking jelly.

>>>	Description	They gasp, their tongues stained gaudy colours. The Conscientious Mercenary snatches the heart from the table and takes a defiant bite. He performs the gesture of "thanking someone for passing food," before turning back to his own dessert. The rest of the table resumes a few moments later, though any relish they'd had in their food is gone. No one even comments when the Sallow Philosopher quietly bundles her serving of kidneys into a handkerchief. She signs you good health and - mouthing a silent "I can't stand it," - passes you the bundle.

>>>	Teaser	You must have been dancing for a few hours now, but it just goes on...
>>>	Description	You must have been dancing for a few hours now, but it just goes on. The only relief from the quiet is the irregular clap from the Master of the Dance. The great chain of dancers weaves through the crowd without a noise. There are formerly holy teachers; once monarchs; warriors without battles; short-changed merchants - a growing and ceaseless parade. Some move with grace, others only sway in their steps out of obligation. The spool continues to unreel.
>>	Name	Keep dancing
>>	Description	How long has it been? The Master of the Dance has obliged more to bite onto the ribbon, but he still has so many left to claim.
>>>	Teaser	Eventually, the Master claps at you, and you bite the ribbon and take your place...
>>>	Description	Eventually, the Master claps at you, and you bite the ribbon and take your place. Shortly thereafter, the spool unwinds completely. There is a modest bang, and the air fills with fluttering papers. On each, a resident of Hideaway has written their secret. The dancers fall on them in a frenzy. You snatch as many as you can.\r\n\r\nThe one whose mercy led to colonial establishment. The seller of names. The one whose theories on Is-Not proved too dangerous. The one who stormed the city - what's this? The name is too smudged to read.

>>>	Description	The Master of the Dance almost lets out a shout; the ribbon falls from his mouth. A few dancers curl their lips and step from the line. The Master clears his throat, and signs - with trembling hands - the closing of the festival. He thanks the people of Hideaway for the celebration of unity, and thanks Temtum for their home. The crowd responds with silent applause. Here and there, you spot a few thanking you with secretive smiles. One even pushes something into your hand: a small token of thanks.

>>	Description	There is a dweller too ancient and too mad to help maintain Hideaway.

>>>	Description	Nook was founded by those fleeing the tyranny of above zee regimes. It is now the nexus of all the Unterzee's illicit trades, and is home to a few rich but paranoid captains of commerce. The wealthy live in fortified mansions cut into the upper rings. The minor traders and dockhands live deeper down, in the cramped lower rings of the Cavities.These workers also tend the oxygenating plantlife that grows in the gaps between their homes. \r\n\r\nBeneath the Cavities there is only the Gullet. It is lightless, and unsounded. No one has returned from exploring its depths. Occasionally it shifts, shaking the city. Nook-dwellers are accustomed to minor tremors.

She will destroy us!" \r\n\r\nAs if on cue, the whole city shifts around you. The crowd erupts in shouts of fear. The figure in a hemp mask produces a small vial and crushes it in his fist. A cloud of ink engulfs him, then he is gone. No! There he is - darting down a narrow tunnel which leads towards the Cavities.\r\n\r\nThe Debonair Deductress appears at your shoulder.

>>>	Teaser	Nookers rarely venture close to the Gullet...
>>>	Description	Nookers rarely venture close to the Gullet. It's not just because of superstitious dread; a near irresistible current sucks down it, pulling food, refuse and the unwary into the depths of the Maw. Only strong swimmers can escape it. \r\n\r\nStill, the current renders your swim downwards swift. After several minutes the ever-murkier water is abruptly lit by hundreds of glowing, tethered eels. They light a vast cut in the wall. Mechanical workings dig into the red Maw-flesh beyond. 
>>>	Name	The Unswum Depths
>>	Name	Head to the Lair of the Hempen Man

The noise tears thought. \r\n\r\n"This one is under <i>my</i> protection." But the mob has dispersed; it is grumbling clumps of mere bystanders.

>>>	Description	over too fast: the other drinkers gather in a loose floating sphere making slow, gonging chants of encouragement to the two women grimly grappling one another. After it is over, it is a moment before you realise that one of the fighters floats dead; the rest return to their drinks while the barman billhooks the body out of the back door. there is no watch to call, even if any were inclined to do so.

>	Teaser	A tall tooth has been carved into a spiralled cone...
>	Description	A tall tooth has been carved into a spiralled cone. It is ringed with delicate patterns, each band representing a stratum of Nook society. It is an honest depiction of the population. The lowest band is oppressively intricate, with hooks and blades gouged into its design. The pinnacle is unmarred and highly polished. The elite find life smooth-living, here. \r\n\r\nToday the shrine seems popular. Is this piety caused by the constant shaking of the ground, or are the Nookers a devout group?

>>>	Teaser	"Our ancestors entered the Maw fleeing tyranny, with nothing but the sacred knives they held in their teeth...
>>>	Description	"Our ancestors entered the Maw fleeing tyranny, with nothing but the sacred knives they held in their teeth. Their enemies left them to their fates, assuming that none could survive in this deepest, darkest, sharpest of crevices. Yet, here in the mouth of providence, they prospered, and we continue to thrive in the Maw's sacred rumination." The sermon over, offerings are loaded into a crate and floated up to the very top of the temple, weighted down, and then pushed out into open water, to fall eventually down into the belly of the Maw. For an instant, a vision overcomes you: you are swimming through the open Zee, dwarfing creatures and reefs alike. The stars are visible through miles of water above. The vision is gone; you are left feeling suddenly, ludicrously small.

>>>	Description	You claw wildly through the water towards your vessel. Your aim is desperate; dark blotches and white cracks flare through your vision. The effort of not breathing burns.

>>>	Description	"The Maw will settle herself," a junior Exarch tells you. "She shelters us, as she always will - if we maintain our faith." His smile aims for 'beatific', but hits 'smug'. "But is there any wonder she stirs, when ingrates plot against her? Speak of <i>killing</i> her? That Hempen Man leads our people astray, drags them down into his cult."  \r\n\r\nBut has this Hempen Man led the children away? Are they among his devotees?\r\n\r\n"<i>I</i> don't know. I'm a priest, not a detective. But if you want to find unsavoury things -" he gurns as if he'd just breathed stagnant water - "I'd visit unsavoury people. The Nerveless are like a dead tooth. They have lost their connection to the Maw. Find them."

>>>	Description	"No doubt she told you to punch me," he says when he sees you empty-handed. "Or... stab me?" A slow smile spreads across his face. "Steal my leg?" He laughs, and slaps his mahogany thigh. "Yes, That's Rosina. I am glad she lives yet, though I wouldn't wish her fate on anyone. Not even myself. Oh, I've paid my price for choices made long ago, and more. But there's no justice where there can be no atonement. That's why I founded this place," he says, looking around at the enamel walls of Nook. "Only the zee's justice here. That is my punishment. That and this, of course," and he shows you the hand he conceals. Not a hand; dozens of pale, translucent cilia undulate in the water. "At least the eels have no taste for me anymore," he says.

>>>	Teaser	You begin to wonder whether the whole game is a prank...
>>>	Description	You begin to wonder whether the whole game is a prank. Or worse, a <i>satire</i>. The other players confidently cite rules and regulations that keep you at the bottom of the table. But surely the requirement that all sixes be under-rolled contradicts the <i>en passant</i> rule? \r\n\r\n"That's the game," one Nooker shrugs. "You'd think a bubble-mouth would understand that life's not fair." The rest chuckle, and split your stake. At least the loser ends up spending the least time with the eel.

>>>	Description	You finish the game only lightly nibbled, and holding every card in the House of Bladders. It's enough to put you over the top. They are impressed that a Trespasser managed to even finish a game. The number of urchin spines you accumulated in the back of your hand determines your share of the pot, and it is surprisingly rich pickings. Not bad for a beginner.
>>>	Name	Victory! - you're told.
>>	Description	Nook may have no rules, but its residents are more than capable of enforcing their opinions. Trespassers may play in <i>this</i> group. The other clusters of players are only interested in challenging fellow Nookers. \r\n\r\n<i>A matter of luck. It could go either way.</i>

>>>	Description	The Conodont lifts his robe, revealing a mahogany leg encrusted with barnacles. He opens a compartment in the thigh, and draws out a wax-paper letter, with a seven-armed octopus seal. "For my sister. Last I heard she was on Anthe," he says, handing you the letter. "I've been breathing Nook water too long; I can't venture out into the Empty, not anymore." He leans back. "Chances are she'll tear it up. I would. But promise me, one way or another you'll tell her I'm sorry."

>>>	Description	At this level the game adds in a bewildering array of spiny dice and three extra sets of cards. Turn order depends on the day of the week. But there is <i>always</i> the eel. \r\n\r\nAnd that is your undoing. Apparently the correct reaction to a mid-game argument about the scale-colour of the eel was to declare the manoeuvre void, because the players involved were playing adjacently, not orthogonally. Who knew?

>>>	Description	The Nooker to your left folds in the face of a double umpire. You add her discarded cards to your own collection - building your hand to a twelve-armed carpenter. You misplay the third dice, but recover by eating it. \r\n\r\nDistracted by the choking sounds the spined item forces you to make, another player drops their guard to reveal a planned lower House. From there, your victory is inevitable. 
>>>	Name	Mastery!
>>	Description	You're not a Nooker, but they'll treat you as one. And welcome you into the higher stakes games. The rules are... Well, the rules are as inscrutable as before.\r\n\r\n<i>A matter of luck. It could go either way.</i>

>>>	Description	Keeping one hand firmly concealed in his coat, the large man accepts the letter and gestures for you to sit. He reads in silence. Several passages are examined at length. At times he turns his gaze on you, then returns to the letter. When he finishes, he crumples the letter in his fist lets out a booming laugh.\r\n\r\n"Sounds like Lorenzo's been stewing in his memories for too long! Tell him all's forgiven - he'd take the blame for London's fall, if he could!"

>>>	Description	Ordinarily in Snaplamprey, you barely understand why you are losing or winning, but here every move is clearly signaled, every trap the Conodont builds is obvious from three moves away, and yet you always seem to end up exactly where he wants you. You lose with an overwhelming sense of inevitability. "Shame," is all he says as he returns to manicuring his eels. "I wondered if you might be who I'm looking for."
>>>	Name	The donkey
>>>	Teaser	He plays in silence, keeping one hand concealed in his coat...
>>>	Description	He plays in silence, keeping one hand concealed in his coat. You watch and wait, matching his every move, until the very end when a clever cash-out lets you trap his Captain against the eel-box. He snaps his dice-rake, signalling capitulation, and then suddenly laughs in something almost like relief. All around you seasoned players are goggling. "Come and see me," the Conodont says as he leaves. "I have need of an bubble-mouth with some gumption."
>>>	Name	Match play
>>	Name	Challenge the Conodont
>>	Description	He floats in a quiet corner, filing the teeth of the eels in his own personal Snaplamprey set. He is said to be the game's only master.
>>>	Teaser	It is a bold attempt, but the eel proves uncooperative...
>>>	Description	It is a bold attempt, but the eel proves uncooperative. It escapes when you try to shift the box widdershins, and soon dice and players are scattering in every direction. Apparently, this alone would be a winning move, but you forgot to declare a carryover before you did it, so all bites are void. The other players grin while ducking the enraged eel. "That's Snaplamprey, for you," one says. "Better luck next time!"
>>>	Name	Aces are wild. Sadly, so are eels.

>>>	Description	You muscle your way across the board, distract other players with dangerously thrown dice and overturn the eel-box, trapping the eel within. The other players eye you askance, but you brazenly cite the Rule of Incisors and dare them to contradict you. A pause; laughter. "Maybe we'll make a Nooker of you yet," one says, blushing slightly as he meets your gaze.

>>	Name	Investigate the Pulp-Mines
>>	Description	The miners hollow out new teeth before the dentarchitects turn them into dwellings. They work close to the Maw, <i>in</i> the Maw, even. They must know something about the quakes.
>>>	Teaser	"Ah, there you are...
>>>	Description	"Ah, there you are. Good show. Do you know, I could almost believe you got here before I did." She laughs gaily. "And look! Children. They aren't all gone. Those silly Nookers must be exaggerating. It's probably just a couple playing hide-and-seek. That makes far more sense." \r\n\r\nThe Maw shudders; its teeth groan together. A deep bass roar rumbles up through the very enamel of the city. The children run shrieking. The Deductress flinches. "I'll make sure these get safely back to the orphanage. We'll meet again."

Fortunately, the three remaining orphans can escape via an upper window. \r\n\r\nMrs Collier is trussed up by the crowd. She floats, helplessly, as members of the mob affix small weights to the rope binding her. She moans and begs for mercy. Finally, she is shoved out over the Gullet. Her howls continue long after she has sunk out of sight.

>>>	Description	There is no fire in Nook, of course, but after what the mob does to the mineworks, you newly appreciate the beauty of a conflagration. Fortunately, most of the miners escape with only minor injuries.\r\n\r\nThe foreman is foolish enough to stand up for his workers. He is grabbed and trussed up by the crowd. He floats, helplessly, as members of the mob affix small weights to the rope binding him. When he realises their intention, he moans and begs for mercy. Finally, he is shoved out over the Gullet. His howls continue long after he has sunk out of sight.
>>>	Name	Ravaged
>>	Name	Divert the Mob's attention to the miners
>>	Description	The miners were seduced by the Hempen Man's promise to kill the Maw, and the implication of vast profit. They have sinned against the Maw. The mob will love that.

>>>	Description	The mob has grown. It is a gleeful, hungry, howling crowd. This time, you've no hope of fighting them off. You must flee, but tactically. Swim too fast, and they'll tire - and find an easier target. Swim too slow, and you'll be overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nYou over-emphasise your ungainly Trespasser swimming style. The mob is hooked. "We're going to throw you in the Gullet, Trespasser!" The rest of what they shout is incoherent with rage. Swim. Swim faster. \r\n\r\nToo close. Your leg is clawed and bleeding by the time you reach your zub. Do all Nookers keep their nails that sharp?
>>	Name	Brave the Mob's Wrath Yourself

This is a huge building. Where are the rest? \r\n\r\n"Asleep. All the children are still here. Definitely here. Sleeping. Go away before you wake them." Mrs Collier's smile is fixed.

>>>	Description	Her smile wobbles, folds, and disappears. "The Maw has always stirred. It has always taken the odd child. And <i>now</i> people care? Now the Maw quakes come all the time, now that scores are missing, <i>now</i> people notice?"\r\n\r\nHer confession is interrupted with great heaving sobs. It's some while before she can speak. "No one cared when it was my Freddy. The Maw ground him up like a morsel - and no one cared."  She raises her chin, attempting defiance. "He promised he'd kill her. The Hempen Man promised me he'd kill the Maw. It wouldn't take any more children. He just needed a bit of help. And afterwards the little workers would return safe. They'll come back. He promised."

>>>	Description	"We were digging deeper and deeper. Quotas, you know?" He seems eager to confess. "We started digging out gum-meat. Them in the Upper Rings have a taste for it. Profits were up. But the Maw became restless." \r\n\r\nHe shrugs. "We were going to have to stop. But then the Hempen Man came. Said he could kill the Maw, leave the meat - generations and generations' worth. And all he wanted was the nerve-cord." He points to the fibrous bundles stacked to one side. "What could be the harm? We used to just throw it away. Now his Nerveless collect it. He's building something in the Gullet." \r\n\r\nThe city shakes violently. In the water, it's hard to tell if the foreman blanches. "He said it'd get worse before it stops. He'll end it, soon.

The Deductress frowns. "This certainly is not your finest work. And why did you have to involve children? You know I hate that."\r\n\r\n"Couldn't have converted my Nerveless if I could only promise them hard work." The Hempen Man is ignoring you entirely. "Look Mina - I can save this city. The people needn't live in a gulping monster. I can do something <i>good</i> for once." He darts backwards towards the wound, swimming like a Nooker. "You shan't stop me."\r\n\r\n"What - you can't!" the Deductress cries, aghast. "<i>I'm</i> the hero! Come back here!"

But he is preoccupied with encouraging the children - via shouted curses, mostly - and you swim past undetected. \r\n\r\nA target for sabotage becomes obvious: each of the bore's supports is held together with one huge pin. Pull these out and- There! The bore creaks, groans, then buckles. The drill-bit bends and twists inside the Maw's flesh; the water fills with a fog of blood. Children and cultists flee for the higher levels.\r\n\r\nThe debris is a mass of sinking and floating parts jostling for freedom. It would be dangerous to linger here.

From the size of the reels they've been using, the rope must go fathoms deep.\r\n\r\nThe children spot you as you swim past, but say nothing. One risks a hopeful smile.

Maybe the Hempen Man <i>ate</i> them." She cackles at your expression. "Don't be silly. He's just another power-hungry man, not a monster. He's nothing that interesting. Although - he is a liar.

>	Description	At the very centre of the heart, the Old Zailors sit meditating around a briny pool of gant - the colour that remains when all others are gone. Most of their clothes have rotted away to nothing or been discarded with the rest of their old lives. The oldest of them sit like statues around the pool. Thick layers of salt armour their desiccated skin.

>>>	Description	You undress and step into the shallow pool. Its surface is the silver of mercury, though that is only a trick of the darkness.

>>>	Description	You step towards the maze of ventricles, as familiar now as the back of your own hand. But something stops you. An exhaustion. A weariness. Of the beasts of the zee and the corruption of the land. The starvation and terror that marks every trip into the dark. Here there is warmth. Safety. You are amongst your own.\r\n\r\nThe more lucid of the Old Zailors reach out. Their withered hands gently relieve you of your heavy belongings and help you out of your suffocating clothes. Their gentle hands lift you from your old life and lower you into the warmth of the Gant pool.

It is all you can do to force your eyes open and stride away from its somnolent lure. \r\n\r\nOnce in the endless maze of ventricles, the spell is broken. The smell of death and decay floods back, almost sweet in its sickly clarity. But your mental map of the place remains. It is not long before you are again by the entrance.

>>>	Teaser	You share the latest news with the zailors who will still listen...
>>>	Description	You share the latest news with the zailors who will still listen. It takes a while. Most stories demand a little more setting up than anticipated. "London? What happened to London?" whispers one. The pull of the Gant Pole is strong. For many it began on the Surface, long before the Cumaean Canal made travel to the Neath so convenient or seemingly possible. Yet still they found their way here. All the old beasts of every zee know where to die.

>>>	Description	You close your eyes and sink deeper into the lake, letting it lap over your ears and cancel out all sound and distraction. Your heartbeat slows. A life of weariness tugs at your eyelids, and soon there is only blackness with a silver aftertaste.\r\n\r\nSome time later, you awaken far from the Old Zailors, in a previously unexplored ventricle. Hours later. Perhaps days. The cold air of the Gant Pole prickles your bare skin. Your fingertips burn. Handwritten text glimmers in the darkness, not all of it legible. A tale of a Heart torn from its owner. A melancholy that calls to those whose stories are over and grants them an end.

>>>	Description	Few have seen more than a gathering of zailors, both of the zee below and the endless blue above. Life sparks briefly in the eyes of the more recent arrivals to this place as they recite memories of battles and escapes. The older ones speak with the whisper of the grave.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes stay closed, imparting half-remembered stories of the city with the silver tree.

"You've been into the bell tower? What did you find?"\r\n\r\nYour explanation thrills him. "The construction of a new relic! A trick, of course, but a well-executed one.

The choir benches are clean, and face a makeshift stage. Lantern-eyed fish pass behind colourful windows of stained glass.\r\n\r\nThe door to the bell tower is guarded by two burly vergers. The tridents are a nice touch.

>>>	Description	The purple mushroom descends from the zub. It shuffles into the nave, scratching at the dirt around the pews. It pauses near the pulpit then - with a decisive wriggle - makes for a dark corner behind the altar.\r\n\r\nA trident whistles through the air and skewers its soft head. A verger strides over, retrieves her weapon and hacks at the wounded blemmigan until the pieces are mush. She gives you a baleful look before returning to her post.

Its body had warped to fit its cage; even its red eyes are distorted, pulled out of alignment by the band across its face.

The water stills. Ship parts and crew sink slowly downwards.

It emits a constant, irritating noise - like the whine of a wasp trapped in honey, amplified and prolonged. Eventually, one of the small grubs pops free. Once on board the ship, the curled, yellow mass wriggles and squeals, before whitening and falling still. A crewman tentatively approaches. The grub writhes to life, burrowing into him hungrily.

Pieces of fluke, like soft lumps of amber, lie dripping on the steel floor. The surgeon abruptly ceases dictating their dissection: "Oh god! The warmth!"

>>>	Description	The fluke liquefies slowly but perceptibly, like a sand-castle washed away by successive tides. Its savage spines leak violant fluids into the zee; its livid flesh sloughs away from its core. That too rots away before your eyes. There is a mournful keening.

The bell ropes sway gently at your back as you ascend.\r\n\r\nSoon you are within reach of the bell. The metal shape is colossal in the confined space, its exterior still shiny despite, presumably, years beneath the zee. You lean over to look inside. The clapper is covered in a dark residue.

You cannot let go! Your feet lift off the ground and the walls flash past as you are yanked <i>inside</i> the bell-\r\nYou are light, all of you. The sun that turns; the touch that burns. The voice of fires and falling spires. The wheel within the wheel within the wheel, contemplating, constructing, consuming. Each click of the cog, the circles colliding and guiding-\r\n\r\nYou struggle free, and fall. The impact of your body on the cold floor slams breath back into your lungs. A verger looks around the door, and seems surprised to see you. He makes a superstitious warding gesture. "Trespasser," he whispers.

The vergers cannot resist explaining to you why that would not work, with reference to pressure differentials and stress points. Behind you, the Parson slips into the bell tower.\r\n\r\nYou step back inside just in time to see him seize the bell rope with both hands and give an almighty pull. BONG! His expression of fascination is replaced by wide-eyed terror as the rope hauls him at breathtaking speed up the tower and inside the bell. There is a brief scream; a damp crunch. Coins shower you, along with a bracing drizzle of gore.\r\n\r\nYou won't be collecting a second fare from the Wandering Parson. But he had a surprising amount of pocket change.

But for now, you laze in a mound of hay - the Vibrant Lady is by your side, dozing. You languidly examine your flesh: parts of you have been stained green from rolling so roughly in the grass. You look over your lover's body. You can't help but smile - she's not really dozing, is she? You hold a hand over her heart. She grins. You both laugh - you can't help yourselves.

You save your laughter until you're away from the walls and by a black lake. \r\n\r\nWild flowers grow by the water. She makes you a crown of them, and nestles it on your head. "Would that I could make you a Lord," she sighs. You kiss her. You are her lover, and that's enough.

A canoe drifts into view around the bend. It's well-laden. Another from the vanished capital, maybe? Not many have come this far south. You take another bite; the spray of juice is lost to the river. \r\n\r\nYou can see the man steering the canoe. You stand, your heart feeling as ripe and ready to burst as the fruit.

"Certainly he owes us <i>something</i> for dragging us all into darkness.

"What, like this?" he asks, rubbing his neck - four fingers thoughtfully stroking the neck, the thumb rolling gently between the collar bones.

In his King's voice, he urges you to further exertions. In a gentler voice, he voices his delight. Your ragged breath mingles with his. In the dark, his mouth tastes the sweat on your neck. The dark?

She thought she'd found a daughter, he laughs. \r\n\r\nHe was tutored in matters of poetry, mathematics, engineering, biology, oceanography, and jurisprudence. Some of Wrack's citizens were educated before they sank. And, of course, you can learn much from tether-visions.\r\n\r\nThe King smiles, and smooths his shirt. "A straightforward affair.

>>>	Description	You step toward the mirror; it flashes in the light.\r\n\r\nYou see yourself, on deck, sabre at your side. You look improbably healthy; restlessly vital. The lights of London glow off your prow. The city, too, is different. A triumphal arch of blazing Mountain-stone has been constructed across the docks, the words 'DEATH HATH NO MORE DOMINION' engraved across it. \r\n\r\nThe streets are lit by steady electric lights, of the kind seen in the Khanate. But the priest-officials you can make out sermonising to the dockside crowds wear white robes, like those popular in the Presbyterate. Hunched over the rooftops is the clawing outline of the Bazaar: a blasted ruin.\r\n\r\nAs you watch, your reflection issues orders. Crewmen - also nimble with preternatural health - hurry to obey. The guns on deck swivel, to train on the great arch...\r\n\r\nThe Fair King's voice interrupts the vision. "I am never sure what it is we are seeing. The gentleman's hopes? His fears?

Men and women from the Surface crowd around him; they look sickly in comparison. One passes him a letter; envelope white as snow, seal as black as bark. The Man reads it and passes the young woman a flask. Before her crewmates can set on her, she has drained it. Her skin glows with new vigour. And before they can set on him, he laughs, and - in the spirit of liberty, equality, and eternity - gives them each a flask of their own. \r\n\r\nThe Fair King's voice interrupts the vision.

Did he always have so many freckles?\r\n\r\nThe Fair King lifts the crown from his head, and holds it out before him. The light catches the gold prettily. And it's there in the barn, as you idly play with a piece of straw, that you accept your crown. The Fair King kisses your forehead, and raises your lips.

Either way, you're glad to take the weight off your old legs.\r\n\r\nThe Fair King speaks of his childhood. You remember the days; you humble his more boastful recollections, and he puffs his cheeks as he always did. As you wait for dinner, he turns over his fork and wonders how much longer it will be. Not dinner - but the time you have together. You ask if he'd like to make a wager. He shakes your hand.

>>>	Description	Satisfied as a fed cat, the collector hands over a roll of yellowing paper. You study it beneath a lantern of reclaimed stained glass. The chart is thick with notes: names, addresses, passphrases, strings of numbers and symbols. Judging by the numbering in one corner, it is only one of several such charts. \r\n\r\nA detail in the compass rose catches your eye: an ornate initial 'B'. And what's this in the margin? A motto? 'LIBERTY, EQUALITY, ETERNITY.'

I'm afraid part of it is rather unwieldy - corpses tend to be, I've found.\r\n\r\n"There's a story behind it, of course. Two brothers lived by the zee. When their mother passed, they divided up her pearls. But there were an odd number, and the brothers fought. One died, the other wept. His tears wetted the last pearl, which hatched. The thing that emerged had his brother's voice."

You claw wildly through the water towards your vessel; into the airlock; gasping in the inch of air with your face pressed to the ceiling as the water is pumped out.

Your search uncovers neither reward nor peril. \r\n\r\nA crewman expels a stream of bubbles - in relief? In frustration? - the moment before an eel as thick as the barrel of your deck gun engulfs his helmeted head. You do for the eel with a machete, but it is too late for your crewman. The zee teaches its lessons swiftly.

Struggling through the ruin, you find the survivor gasping through the last of his air. For a frantic few minutes, you assist him into your second suit. His strength is spent. You pull him out. The winch pulls you both back aboard your zubmarine, which your grateful guest swears he'll never leave.

Her greatcoat is still on her chair, an olive-green water-damaged journal poking from the left pocket. \r\n\r\nBack on the zubmarine, you read what little remains legible. A defection was intended, to the 'New Sequence.' 'I want only to remember the sun,' she wrote, 'the sun, the sun, the sun.' An ambition thwarted by the zee.

Inside is a locked steel box.\r\n\r\nBack in your zubmarine, you prise it open. It contains a handful of interesting papers, and a journal logging the ships visiting the Grand Geode. The word 'COMPROMISED' is written next to each one.

His jaw hangs open; the fish have had his eyes. You move behind him to examine the room; your navigator bangs on the cabin door twice. The captain is facing you. You depart, quickly..

The wreck's hull yields with a dull clang. \r\n\r\nInside, gloomy steel corridors extend through the tilting vessel. The zubmarine has lost its crew - perhaps they escaped. The Captain did not; a peligin-stained skeleton sits alone, a hat and journal the only indicators of her rank. The remains of the journal reveal an unfinished apology to a lover in London.

A corridor stretches before you, and here is what's left of the vessel's crew.\r\n\r\nTwo neatly-placed lines of skulls face each other. Their eye sockets and jaws have been caulked closed with something resinous. Your diving gear is awkward. Your foot disturbs a skull; it rolls on its side, and you see it's sealed underneath. \r\n\r\nA cracking sound. The skull rocks, this time without your help. Another dull crack. Its parietal bone breaks, drifts away. From inside something uncoils, black and glistening, centipedal, trimmed with writhing cilia. It gropes towards you, unwinding to shoulder height - how did all that fit inside a skull?\r\n\r\nAnother crack from behind you. Another. You flee, as the skulls begin to hatch.

Something shivers against your thigh.\r\n\r\nYou are separated from your crew. A wrong turning between two ballasts; you find yourself in a corridor piled high with skulls, neatly stacked against the bulkheads. Over the eye sockets and mouths, a black resin like olive paste has dried. Every grin is stained as though by red wine; between the teeth dark waxy strings like melted cheese cling.\r\n\r\nA hand on your shoulder - the engineer. "Only old bones, captain."

The wood of the deck is blistered and scorched by old gunfire. \r\n\r\nBelow decks, the cabins show evidence of a slaughter. Old stains coat the walls. The blood must have dried before the ship sank. In the third cabin you reach, a white-eyed woman, her skin bloated, gnaws on a comrade's severed hand. Strings of gristle cling to her teeth. She looks up, uncomprehending. Your first officer cleaves her head from her shoulders.

The blood must have dried before the ship sank.\r\n\r\nA Drownie waits within, white-eyed. Rotten flesh clings to her lips. She spits out part of a comrade as you approach. "Couldn't help myself. Done now." Her voice sings through the water. "What's left is yours." She darts - minnow-quick - through a porthole, abandoning her vessel's treasures to your salvage party.

The body is bloated and engorged - stretching the seams of its white and gold uniform. "Margarite poisoning," your doctor pronounces. "Self-inflicted, by the looks of it." He pries the jaw open.

The writing reveals the ship was bound for Scrimshander, containing a precious cargo: a brilliant historian's lost work. The log tells of a passenger obtained; a jilly-stung Chelonate hunter. It describes how he insisted that he be allowed into the cargo hold. Of a pitched battle that ensued when he wasn't. Dried stains underfoot tell the rest. The hold remains secure. \r\n\r\nBreaking it open, you discover a box of bone carvings providing an description of the Chelonate's great turtle and an account of its death. According to this account, the turtle was not hunted - as the Chelonates claim - but was already dead when they found it.\r\n\r\n[You could deliver the bone carvings to Scrimshander.]

Here: a panel. You try to pry it off. The device shudders. An expulsion of silent blackness engulfs you.\r\n\r\nIt devours the light of your ship's beams like a glutton at Sunday dinner.

>>>	Description	You scour the zee-bed, upturning once-human fragments. A fractured skull, whose teeth appear to have been forcibly removed. A tibia, hollowed and sucked dry of marrow. A single copper band on a hand severed at the wrist and plucked of fingers. The zee has been cruel. 
>>>	Name	You don your diving gear
>>>	Teaser	The bones are far from any wreck...
>>>	Description	The bones are far from any wreck. They have been gnawed upon, perhaps even digested, then evacuated. All of value that remains are the things they chose to die with. An amulet of St Jude; a locket bearing a strand of white hair; a scrap of paper, ink lost to the zee. On the less damaged finger-bones, a few rings slide off with ease.

>>>	Description	You and your crew don suits and descend to the zee-floor. These bones have been badly treated - most are little more than splintered fragments.

The sudden sensation of cold water on your skin; a blazing pain... An abrupt, overwhelming injection of indignation, and rage, and grief!\r\n\r\nYour crew reel you in, tends your wound, and locks you in your cabin until you stop shrieking.

It illuminates a shoal of fish skirting around and away from the wreck. The cargo hold is yawning wide, offering easy entrance.\r\n\r\nYour bo'sun is to remain outside while the rest of you go in. She will sound the time in sevens. "Be out in fourteen minutes," she warns, "After seven, the fear sets in. Twice that, the hallucinations. Thrice that, you'll go dark. No coming back."

Beneath, hammers ring, drills whirr, mechanics argue, reconcile, improvise.\r\n\r\nFrom the outside, your ship looks largely unaltered. But inside, new pipes gleam. A satisfying lever stands by the helm, surrounded by an array of mysterious gauges and dials. "This extends the shell-hull,"  a weary engineer explains. "Don't pull it until you're out at zee, eh?"\r\n\r\nThe Fierce Philanthropist offers you a sherry. "We've done it," she says. "To your new journeys, [q: Addressed As], wherever they may lead."

They called themselves the Seven." She does not sound entirely disapproving. \r\n\r\n"My husband shielded me from the details of his endeavour, although I have made a number of suppositions. I know for certain, however, that it ended in disaster. He and his co-conspirators fled beneath the waves. If you could find him, he may be able to lead you to the others."\r\n\r\n"If you locate him, please give him this," she hands you a locket containing a miniature portrait of herself. "It is likely that he is dead, or unable to return. But if possible, I would like him to remember me." She takes an abrupt sip of sherry.

The world is unjust. If only it were possible to do more, you intimate. Charity, after all, can only mitigate the symptoms of tragedy, not prevent it. \r\n\r\nThe Philanthropist peers at you. "What are you getting at?" You allow her to coax it from you with the application of sherry. Though she knew the rough shape of her husband's former endeavour, this is the first time she has heard the full story. Now it's all she has left of him, she is hungry for it. She leans forwards, cheeks flushed, eyes dark.\r\n\r\nYou debate and quarrel and conspire all through the night. As the servants are beginning to rouse, she shakes your hand with a fierce grip. "I'll join your Seven. You've my support and - more practically - my pockets." The sherry is gone, alas, but she raises an empty glass. "Here's to bloodying death's nose."\r\n\r\n

When you finish, only lamplight spilling through the window allows you to see at all. \r\n\r\nThe Fierce Philanthropist is still in her chair.

Grey, bloated, and nearly embalmed by the fungal smoke, it's difficult to tell where his skin ends and the stone bed beneath him begins. His breath is shallow, but his bare chest heaves to a different rhythm. A shape crawls beneath his ribs, but disappears as the man lets out a gassy sigh.\r\n\r\n"Allow me to introduce you, [q:Addressed As]," the Incomparable Aurelian says, slipping you a modest payment, "This is Lorenzo, my erstwhile mentor and host to the Most-Moth."

Almost had me that last time. Isery - that's their name."\r\n\r\nHe remembers one more thing. "And if you have better luck this time, it'd be good to be remembered. I don't need an arch, or a statue.

"I get my proficiency with metal from both sides of the family," she says, watching your expression closely. Then: "Mother was a favourite with Mr Iron. She says that they only worked together, that Mr Iron sponsored her work and provided her with tools. Sharper tools that do not bend so easily."

>>>	Description	You sit with her in a surgery lined with bottles of preserved and pickled body parts.\r\n\r\n"I can't offer you proof," she says. "The only strange tongue I speak is my mother's, which is ancient but human. Blades can cut me. I'm not immune to fire (though perhaps the Masters are not either). But I have not met anyone who shares my particular skills. And I know my mother. I cannot see her in any ordinary liaison with an ordinary man, much less a husband. She was in her third millennium when she bore me."

>>>	Description	She undresses you and stands scowling at you, as if choosing where to make an incision.\r\n\r\nThen: fingertips and the point of her tongue. She is not exactly impatient, but determined and precise, and she knows exactly what will produce the most intense sensation. Your vision blackens near the end, but she never <i>quite</i> goes too far. \r\n\r\nWhen you are too drained and dizzy to move, she gives you a smug look that you could possibly interpret as affection.
>>>	Name	No caresses
>>	Name	Proposition the Cladery Heir

Did you even hear his real voice? He could have been anyone!

>>>	Description	"If the ship is in ice, then perhaps the cladent lobe has frozen. The <i>Cladery Heart</i> might be no more than an ordinary vessel now... still, even if that is so, there would be much to study." But whatever she says, the Cladery Heir plainly hopes to find the ship alive.

>>>	Description	She asks what you want removed. Then she makes you consent three times to having it taken away.\r\n\r\nThen, the blade. There's pain in your ear, yes, but that is not the chief sensation. The other thing is a noise and a resistance like shears through heavy cloth. It is located in your mind and at the back of your neck. Your eyes go black.\r\n\r\n"I haven't blinded you," she says mildly, as you sit there blinking and swallowing. "But it will feel for a time as if I had. You lost a great deal of light."

>>>	Name	Box delivered to the surgery
>>>	Teaser	She refuses to let you watch while she works on the contents of the box...
>>>	Description	She refuses to let you watch while she works on the contents of the box. But afterward, she is in a dark mood, and complains in generalities. People are fools. No one dares face up to what is wrong with them. Hiding a secret from yourself does not make it go away. Pretending anger doesn't exist is not the same thing as patience. \r\n\r\nWhatever operation she's just done, she's kept a souvenir from it, but she won't show anyone what it is. She wraps it in cotton wool and keeps it in a little lacquered box left over from the sale of tea.

>>>	Teaser	No no no...
>>>	Description	No no no.\r\n\r\nYou must be jealous of her history. You must be trying to manage her for yourself. You must have been using her for the Cladery Heart all along. She has no more use for you. People like her can make their fortunes anywhere. \r\n\r\nYou don't see her go, but when you check the ship in the morning, she has gone. Overboard? Did she swim? However she went, she took her knives and her specimens with her.
>>>	Name	No
>>>	Teaser	Her mother is not the concubine of a Master...
>>>	Description	Her mother is not the concubine of a Master. Her father will never bring her knife-steel tempered in a baby star. Her lineage is merely human. Her city is only the mortal city that first fell into the Bazaar. She must give up waiting for an unimaginable future to blossom of its own accord.\r\n\r\nThe two of you speak about it late into the night, and then she goes into her operating room with a scalpel and a mirror. \r\n\r\nWhen she comes out, she has her small toe preserved in a whiskey jar, and a happy indifference to the question of her parentage.
>>>	Name	Hard to let go

Now she wears gloves, but she's kept her marriage."\r\n\r\n"There's more difficult work I could be doing." She is playing her blade between her fingers. "Did you know my mother operated on the Bazaar itself? She cut away its cladent lobe so that it would be at peace and not have to wander on and on. But the operation changed her. She got some of the ichor on her skin." [To acquire a Cladery Souvenir, you must find something for the Heir to operate on.

>>>	Description	The Cladery Heir emerges from her surgery in a depressed mood. The body is wrapped in linen for disposal.\r\n\r\n"There was nothing wrong with the technique," she tells you. "If they'd been willing, it might have cured them of certain ailments... but they fought back under the knife. And what I extracted wouldn't be fit to stuff a sausage."

>>>	Description	This will require special equipment: the smallest knives, magnification lenses, strong light, a sieve. Do you have some finely-woven silk by any chance? No matter, it was a whim...\r\n\r\nShe works all night. In the morning, the blemmigan is gone and she has a vial of shifting, cosmogone powder. "I would advise against eating any of this, unless you fancy a very altered state of mind."

>>>	Description	She draws the creature in both its appearances, as fish and as blossom. "I operate on desires. Compulsions. Requirements. Sometimes those compulsions are based in self-delusion, and that is where the Mollyflower might come in handy. Dull the pain of parting with a bad wish."

Two apologies, in fact. \r\n\r\nThe first is for conducting an affair with the recipient's cousin, 'Rosina'. The second is for a military blunder. The Almost Dead Man was a scout, who failed to detect the approach of 'the Hyenas' - enemy reinforcements? The outcome, it seems, was catastrophic.\r\n\r\nSensitive subjects.

It's hard to tell which of these are frantic acts performed in the excitement of battle, and which are imagined flourishes.\r\n\r\nThe letter speaks with more than lust.

Her diminutive size proves useful - she's as easy to carry as a sack of flour. \r\n\r\nYour navigator gives up his bunk for the Nook-child, who speaks to you between bouts of unconsciousness.

Now, we give what we can, in gratitude." \r\n\r\nThe sermon finishes, and offerings are loaded into a vast crate. This is floated up to the top of the temple, then pushed out into water over the Gullet.

She hooks her legs in and applies a rear naked choke. It's locked in - victory takes seven more seconds.

She speaks to it in the native tongue of the First City, a language cluttered with velar stops. \r\n\r\nIn the fifth hour of these rituals, the Heart begins to thrum again. It wants to be free of the ice. It wants to move. It wants to swim.\r\n\r\n"South," says the Heir. "Wait for us in Port Carnelian. It isn't safe to change ships here." The Heart beats twice before taking a new heading. [For now, the Cladery Heart awaits in Port Carnelian.

>>>	Description	The inhabitants of Scrimshander spend much of their time praying on the mysteries of the past. They spend almost as much time arguing about their interpretations. Salted residents often collect nearby salvage, studying the results and inscribing their interpretations on any skeletal remains. But those who leave too often are easily recognised by what they have left behind in their travels: memories, personalities, and bones.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, they rarely consider the present - certainly not with the same focus they give to the histories buried within their tower. Recent world events are met with polite silence, unless it prompts an anecdote about similarities with antiquity. Apart from old grudges and new theories, very little changes here.

Each brick is heavier than the last, and the work becomes a blur. Sweat beads and trickles down your back. Running down your face. Soaking through your clothes.

When you've made yourself comfortable, she hands you her bone quill and asks you to write the names of your crew.\r\n\r\nThe quill is clumsy in your hand as you write.

It was designed to survive the abyss, to allow mankind to flourish in impossibility. Few imagined he could have survived; fewer still could imagine that he found a companion. And though he since died, all exiles have found their home next to his.

>>>	Teaser	Ships have always sunk into the zee...
>>>	Description	Ships have always sunk into the zee. Zailors have always drowned. But there was once a strong ship which did not fall to the ordinary fate. \r\n\r\nIt was swallowed by the waves, and all hands were presumed lost. But it was not so. By their captain's leadership, the crew survived their own destruction and made a home in the wreck at the bottom of the zee. In time, the captain became the Queen, and - through blasting powder and treachery - managed not only to provide for the city, but to expand it.
>>>	Name	The captain who lived
>>	Description	Deep within a forgotten corner, a grinning skeleton bears a catalogue of extraordinary deeds. The Chelonate's champions are bound to be interested.
>>>	Teaser	This skeleton is scorched, cracked, and broken...

>>>	Teaser	Strict discipline must be maintain at zee, lest the waves take you...
>>>	Description	Strict discipline must be maintain at zee, lest the waves take you. The navies of the Neath are stricter than their surface counterparts, and perhaps more cruel. Not every zailor can comport themselves. \r\n\r\nSome, it is said, leap overboard willingly, in search of a city where the water is air, the meat is plentiful, and there is no lash and no brig.
>>>	Name	The left behind
>>	Description	You find yourself in a hovel of stacked bones, each inscribed with the name and tale of a drowned corpse.
>>>	Teaser	It was said that a flower in the zee grew within the zee, one that any true lover would pluck for their beloved...
>>>	Description	It was said that a flower in the zee grew within the zee, one that any true lover would pluck for their beloved. If nothing else, it was a proof of bravery, devotion, and diving talent - all conventionally attractive qualities. \r\n\r\nMany dived, most died: but a few found the flower, and found that it was not what they expected. It was beautiful beyond their imagining. And though a pretty poetic conceit had send them below, it was not enough to bring them back up. They abandoned their old lovers, in death or for beauty. 
>>>	Name	Rituals of love
>>	Name	Unearth a portrait of a time
>>>	Teaser	There is a King who sees a city which delights him...
>>>	Description	There is a King who sees a city which delights him.  He longs to rule it, though it can never be his. But he is unperturbed: he may have a fantasy of the city, and that is enough to satisfy his whim. \r\n\r\nNo power in the zee cared to stop the city from rising, and so the King populates it with subjects at his discretion. They live in a phantom reality: one that is beautiful enough to disguise its truth.
>>>	Name	Fashions of the day
>>	Description	Travellers of all eras from across the Neath have been brought here to rest. Perhaps something can be synthesised from their collections.
>>>	Teaser	You examine a sculpture...
>>>	Description	You examine a sculpture. It shows two gentlemen - one of the Khanate, the other European - and a woman of the Elder Continent. They are leaning together, their foreheads touching; the lower halves of the figures are unfinished. Next, you come across a quartet of statues - begun, then abandoned - of a narrow, bespectacled man. His features are subtly different in each attempt, as if the sculptor was trying to get them right. MEMORY LIES is inscribed upon the base of the last of them.\r\n\r\nAnd here: a kingly man of the Presbyterate, pierced with arrows and sinking to one knee. Is this the Presbyter himself? He is crowned, and carries a set of tablets. Upon one is written 'THE PRESTER SAITH: none shall live a thousand years'. On another, less neatly, is inscribed 'THIS HISTORY WAS WRITTEN BY THE LOSERS' \r\n\r\nYou hear a woman's voice, echoing through the tunnels. "Healer, Schemer, Soldier, Guide. Propagandist, Financier and Captain. Rosina, myself, Batuk, Lorenzo. Bourdain, Lytton and Arik." You follow the voice, but it fades into the maze-like tunnels. You help yourself to a memento: a perfect apple carved from the the blue-black bone, and depart.\r\n\r\n
>>	Name	Explore a knot of passages clogged with half-finished statues
>>	Description	Both its walls and the statues are made from the near-black bones of zee-beasts.
>>>	Teaser	Every bone of the midnight whale is intact, and every inch has been densely carved with words...
>>>	Description	Every bone of the midnight whale is intact, and every inch has been densely carved with words. The writing appears to be Greek, in an ancient script, but you recognise the carvings all bear the same hand. The work must have taken the author years. Decades.\r\n\r\nThe base of the whale's skull bears a crude portrait. You've seen this man and his immaculate beard before. No wonder he's so quick to laugh at the historical plays far above.
>>>	Name	The belly of the whale
>>	Name	The first skeleton of Scrimshander

>>>	Teaser	The repository is filled with statues carved from the same black bone as the walls, the ceiling, the floor...
>>>	Description	The repository is filled with statues carved from the same black bone as the walls, the ceiling, the floor. This statue exults over the body of a fallen foe; this one drags itself up a shingled slope; this one is a child with the bleak eyes of an old man. The floor is carpeted in thick, dark bone-dust. \r\n\r\nYou move deeper into the serried population of statues. Wait - that one is not a statue - it's a woman, observing you with peligin eyes. She wears a dusty apron. One hand holds a delicate brush, the other a thin, gleaming chisel.

>>>	Teaser	Shards and skulls press in on all sides...
>>>	Description	Shards and skulls press in on all sides. Only a burst of desperate strength saves you from the worst of it. But you may never forget the skull that was almost your final vision. Its inscription bragged of a peaceful death. Rarely have you so envied a skeleton.
>>>	Name	Buried alive - briefly
>>>	Teaser	You look back on the collapsed tunnel behind you...
>>>	Description	You look back on the collapsed tunnel behind you. In the puddling remains, you find the culprit: a burrowing boneworm, all teeth and cillia. Good for bait, bad for remains. And mercifully crushed in the passage's collapse.
>>>	Name	A narrow escape
>>	Name	Bonequake!
>>	Description	A shower of bone dust falls from above. Then a trickle of water. Suddenly the bones supporting this passage crumble above you. Run!
>>>	Teaser	Her knife grazes your shoulder as you flee, but she is content to let you escape...
>>>	Description	Her knife grazes your shoulder as you flee, but she is content to let you escape. The wet work of a flensing knife echoes through the hallways behind you. Apparently not all monks in Scrimshander are content to let history find victims at its own pace.
>>>	Name	Driven off
>>>	Teaser	You parry her lunge and she flees into the dark, leaving the partially-peeled monk...
>>>	Description	You parry her lunge and she flees into the dark, leaving the partially-peeled monk. But wait - its bones have already been inscribed, even where the flesh has only just been stripped away. Through the viscera, you can read an account of the poor soul's final moments.
>>>	Name	A fate written in bone
>>	Name	Attacked by a mad monk!

>>>	Name	Did that one move?
>>>	Teaser	This one's wrappings are of a different quality than the rest...

>>>	Name	A royal sort of remains
>>	Name	Stumble upon mummified remains
>>	Description	The remains in this ancient hallway aren't bone, but mummified remains wrapped in linens, lying in repose. One could almost mistake it for tomb-colonists at tea.

>	Description	A gap in this colossal zee monster's throat has been forced open with thick heartmetal beams. They strain under the pressure, but hold. As you pass through, your zubmarine lights pass over a message carved in a floating piece of some unfortunate's hull. BEYOND IS NOOK. BEYOND IS FREEDOM. BEYOND IS- The rest is scratched out.

>>>	Teaser	You don your heavy diving suit and give the order to cycle the airlock...
>>>	Description	You don your heavy diving suit and give the order to cycle the airlock. Water rushes in and you begin the slow swim down into the port. It soon becomes obvious that you are over-dressed for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe people of Nook swim and breathe in the cloudy Maw-water with no apparent discomfort. Most are naked, with just a few clad in rotten rags that stream from their skin with no concern for modesty.\r\n\r\nNone will communicate with you, if they even can. Those who acknowledge your presence just laugh silently at your bulky suit and unnecessary air-hose. You'll need a different approach.
>>>	Name	Trespasser in Freedom
>>	Name	Enter Nook
>>	Description	Water presses against the airlock door. The breathing and slithering of the beast gives it the rhythm of a drumbeat.
>>>	Teaser	You undress; every button, every stitch...
>>>	Description	You undress; every button, every stitch. The door opens. Ice-cold water rushes upwards. Instinct holds your mouth shut. Ten seconds. Twenty seconds. Your lungs burn, holding in that last gulp of air; your legs thrash. You can't hold it in. It escapes! You're choking on water. It forces its way into your lungs, the taste of burning salt suffocating every attempt to gasp, scream or-\r\n\r\nThen, through the exhaustion and panic, you realise you're breathing. It's hard work. Your lungs fight against the weight. But it's enough. You can tolerate it, at least for now.\r\n[The liberal application of wine will make this process easier - in future, bring a cask.]
>>	Name	Descend naked into Nook
>>	Description	At least you're unlikely to run into anyone you know.
>>>	Teaser	Again, you remove your clothes and put them safely in the watertight diving suit compartment...
>>>	Description	Again, you remove your clothes and put them safely in the watertight diving suit compartment. As the water rushes in, you are ready; taking gulps to speed the transition. It feels less like drowning, now, and more like baptism. You swim into Nook with skin and mind tingling, reborn in the airlock's cold steel.
>>>	Name	Undressing for adventure
>>	Name	Return to Nook
>>	Description	You have the measure of the place now. And you have learned that the liberal ingestion of wine before a visit increases your tolerance for nook-water.\r\n

>	Teaser	A huge tooth hosts this ongoing orgy...
>	Description	A huge tooth hosts this ongoing orgy. Thrashing bodies float and press against the polished walls, with convenient water currents removing the worst of the effluence.\r\n\r\nThough most Nookfolk take full advantage of their three dimensions of movement to explore and indulge, many are willingly tied to the point of immobility in spider-silk and even salvaged wire. Their skin glows with hues of blue and purple.
>	Name	UNUSED Bacchanalia in Ivory
>>>	Teaser	Her tongue presses eagerly against yours...
>>>	Description	Her tongue presses eagerly against yours. She stops you from floating away by digging her ragged fingernails into your cheeks. Her writhing body wraps around yours with the slippery finesse of an eel. She drags you down, deeper into the tooth, and then deeper into her embrace. When all is done, she kisses you gently on your forehead. Her eyes do not leave yours as she lifts your wrist to her mouth. She bites down - sharply, firmly, gently - suckling at the warm blood.
>>>	Name	Blood and seduction
>>	Name	Approach the Raven Haired Dotress
>>	Description	She bites her lip, long hair streaming behind her head.
>>>	Teaser	The Gentleman goes to work...
>>>	Description	The Gentleman goes to work. The thin silk bites into your arms and legs as he tightens knots. No touch is more than a brush; an unfulfilled promise of more. Red pain spreads from under the bonds. Never does his kiss reach your lips. Your limbs ache and tingle; there is anguished freedom in such constraints. Your body shakes - with pain, or pleasure. Pleasure, certainly, when the evening ends and the bonds are finally cut free.
>>>	Name	Ties and turns
>>	Name	Approach a Mischievous Eyed Gentleman 
>>	Description	His gaze lingers on you as he toys with a long length of silk. That smile is surely an offer.

>>>	Teaser	They each take one of your hands to pull you deep into the throng of bodies...
>>>	Description	They each take one of your hands to pull you deep into the throng of bodies. It seems both are keen to share - themselves with you, and you with each other. Someone in the writhing mess of bodies drops spider-silk rags thick enough to blindfold. These are employed immediately. The anonymity is liberating, the pleasure unconstrained by gravity or propriety. The moment is prolonged.

>>	Name	Return to the crew
>>	Description	Air again. How refreshing.
>>>	Teaser	Your buttons are an irritation...
>>>	Description	Your buttons are an irritation. You abandon the last three. Your collar itches intolerably. You tug it loose. You are perhaps not regulation-straight as you proceed to your quarters. "Everything all right, [q:Addressed As]?" a crewman asks, warily. [The more time you spend in Nook, the more it will change you and unnerve your crew. Sacrifice Memories to the Flukes of Aigul to counter its effects.]
>>>	Name	The crew murmurs as you pass
>>	Name	Return to the crew
>>	Description	The air is uncomfortable in your throat. Cold. Thin.
>>>	Teaser	You stamp through the close, confining corridors...
>>>	Description	You stamp through the close, confining corridors. The air tickles intolerably at your throat, and you rasp like a cat with a furball. Crewmen scurry from your path. One opens his mouth to comment, then wisely decides to go and check on the boilers instead.  [The more time you spend in Nook, the more it will change you and unnerve your crew. Sacrifice Memories to the Flukes of Aigul to counter its effects.]
>>>	Name	The crew shrinks back as you pass
>>	Name	Return to the crew
>>	Description	As the water drains, so does the glorious, liberating buoyancy of Nook. Your limbs drag like lead. The air is cold and still as the contents of a corpse's lungs. 
>	Teaser	A torn, pinned-back cavity in the flesh wall offers access to the city's monstrous host...
>	Description	A torn, pinned-back cavity in the flesh wall offers access to the city's monstrous host. Razor-sharp teeth the size of buildings jut from fatty, garnet-red flesh. Many teeth have been quarried out into homes, barricaded by scraps of wood from shipwrecks.

>>	Name	Swim Downwards
>>	Description	To the Serrated Abyss.
>>>	Teaser	A vile place...
>>>	Description	A vile place. Festering. Acidic. No laws but those of tooth and claw, written in scars. Civilisation? Impossible - making tea would be a logistical impossibility.\r\n\r\nYet the inhabitants seem content. Many have come here from London, the Khanate, the Presbyterate; abandoning cultured life for this tenuous existence. They grin, their mouths full of stolen flesh, or float naked and carefree. Many have nothing, and nothing to lose.\r\n\r\nA group of swimmers dart past, hunting gleefully. One squeezes your shoulder, companionably. You've never met her before.

>>	Name	Return to the Zubmarine
>>	Description	Better not leave the crew waiting too long.
>>>	Teaser	They acknowledge your presence, but little more...
>>>	Description	They acknowledge your presence, but little more. Most shrink back, assuming you mean harm. Other's deliberately swim just above you in a crude attempt at intimidation. They carry bone knives, or tooth-tipped spears.\r\n\r\nA few gesture to you - in welcome? Invitation? It is unclear. The slightly glutinous water makes speech impossible, so the natives have developed a language of signs. You can interpret the most basic: a finger pulled across a throat, for example, is one of the more polite invitations to depart.

>>>	Description	You pick one of the feebler-seeming Nookfolk - an elderly gentleman, perhaps once a zailor. But the heavy water blunts your blows and your movement, while your victim is practiced, nimble, vicious. His teeth sink into your shoulder. You manage to tear him off you, and he swims away like a minnow.
>>>	Name	As above, so below
>>>	Teaser	You pick your target - a rangy man with a bag of the phosphorescent globules that provide light down here...
>>>	Description	You pick your target - a rangy man with a bag of the phosphorescent globules that provide light down here. He doesn't have as many scars as most, but he's missing an eye. You approach from his blind side, and above launching yourself from a Nook-tooth like a torpedo. He fights, but an arm around his neck cuts off breathable water as well as it would air. The other Nookfolk pay no attention as you claim his stash.

>>>	Name	In the darkness
>>>	Teaser	Shards of pottery, and - what's this?
>>>	Description	Shards of pottery, and - what's this? A handful of jewels, sparkling in the tartar you chipped from the tooth. The Nookfolk show no interest in them. But they should fetch a reasonable price on the markets, even if no specialist collectors are likely to be interested.

>>>	Description	These deeper Nookfolk either lack the confidence or strength to take a tooth for a home. Instead, they make use of the beast's walls. You follow their example. A bit of floating scrap, just sharp enough, slices through the flesh and exposes the soft tissue behind.\r\n\r\nYou slide your legs into the warm meat and sinew, trying not to gag on the sudden rush of blood. The muscle clamps shut around your legs and chest. It would not be hard to pull yourself out, but unlikely that you'd find yourself floating defenseless up to the scavengers above, or down into the depths of the stomach. And it is warm. Warm as a moist blanket. Against your better judgement, your eyes start to close.

Until the light-from-above blinds you and the ghosts come. "Cap'n?" they seem to say through the water. "Cap'n? What happened to-"\r\n\r\nGhosts mean nothing. You fear no ghost. You savour their fear instead, as you lick what used to be your arm; the bone carved into a sharp blade. Blood in the water. There is always blood in the water. No longer yours. Soon, theirs.

The two of you are alone on deck - your crew has refused to be present.  \r\n\r\nOnce dressed, the Salvager clanks over to the gap in the railing.

In the middle of their number is a skeleton, picked clean, lit by a cluster of discarded nodules. And something else glints in the light. Polished gems, of no use to these monsters.

>>>	Description	The ship is pinned only loosely to the great teeth. As you are exploring, it shifts.

>>>	Description	The corridors are slowly rotting, being absorbed into flesh. You seem to be the first to discover it, save for the occasional giant maggot that writhes through the inverted corridors or oozes through a porthole window.

>>>	Description	The Nookdiver brandishes a knife at the sight of you, but a few gestures calm him down. How long has he been trapped down here? Long enough for the experience to have soured him on Nook entirely. When you convey that you have a vessel waiting, he pleads for the chance to sign on. On his journey to your zub, he gestured to a few other Nookfolk.

>>>	Description	This is how Nook disposes of its dead. They are wrapped in strands of weed, weighted with lead (knots of sounding weights scavenged from sunken ships, it looks like), and sunk into the gullet. The lead weights have caught in the bend, and the corpses - tugged by the current - strain on their end of their tethers.\r\nThese deeper, acidic waters have eaten at them. The oldest are just corpse-stubs, now, while the newest are still mostly wrapped. There are no grave-goods; the Nook-folk would pick the dead clean.  \r\nIs this how Nook keeps their host's hunger from growing too great? By feeding it their dead?

Were you laughing?

I'm just- " His hand tightens on the railing.\r\n\r\nThe Drownie Postman stares up at you both.

>>>	Description	Rosina braces herself in the ice bath and prepares for the Song. You cannot replicate exactly how it sounds in the air-water of Dahut, but its contradictions come through clear enough.

>>>	Description	Rosina is dying of animescence, the disease of the Elder Continent. Any passion speeds the disease. She must, therefore, lie very still in an ice bath and think of things that do not interest her. Going sharp in the spleen protects her against the passion of anger, but other passions are still a danger.\r\n\r\nFor a long time she looked for a cure to the disease. Tradition ascribes healing features to certain poems, ointments, and postures of the body. But these only delay the gradual combustion.

>>>	Description	For a long time, she looked for cures of the body. "I was certain the inhabitants of the Elder Continent would be able to correct what is wrong," she says. "But if they know how, they refuse to say. Now... I merely keep back the disease as long as I can, and seek cures of the sentiment instead. If I keep very calm, my symptoms subside. If you find anything in your travels – works of philosophy or guidance – that might help me compose myself, please bring them to me."

You allow yourself some reflections upon theories of esquivalience as they pertain to performative duties in highly dissimulative societies...\r\n\r\nRosina's nurse touches your elbow. "First sound sleep she's had in weeks," she whispers, with a nod at the resting patient. "It'll do wonders for her. Specially if she can avoid dreaming."

You cannot replicate exactly how it sounds in the air-water of Dahut, but its contradictions come through clear enough. It is hard to take either joy or sorrow too seriously, if you believe the Song.\r\n\r\nYou sing for a long time. Rosina looks ever more meditative and tranquil. One of the onlookers takes off his robe and leaves the room before you finally finish.

>>>	Description	Did you fail to mention the nature of the letter? Rosina is reads her lover's words. At the first sentence, the page singes at her touch. Another line and the ice in her tub steams. \r\n\r\nA quick-witted nurse leaps to prevent disaster. "Get out," she growls, having sequestered the letter in her apron. "Tell Lorenzo his love will be her death." Rosina is silent, but her eyes burn.
>>>	Name	A love letter consumed, consuming
>>>	Teaser	Rosina will not deny the letter...
>>>	Description	Rosina will not deny the letter. But at your warnings, she takes every precaution.\r\n\r\nHer nurses prepare fresh ice for the tub. One sings a sombre hymn. Another transcribes the letter onto separate pages - each sentence, to be administered as the Burning Lady's disposition allows her to receive them.\r\n\r\nRosina reads slowly. She looks in your direction: her expression is fierce, as though you were talking in church. You step away into the other room until she is ready for you to return. Already you have seen enough - the page in her hand curls, languorously, from the heat.
>>>	Name	A love letter, carefully consumed
>>	Name	Present a love letter to Rosina

>>>	Teaser	"Enough! - 
>>>	Description	"Enough!" She holds up a hand almost at the first note. "I recognise the tune. Who let you in here? Are you an agent of the Continent? Get out." If her spleen weren't a lump of crystal, she would be much angrier.\r\n\r\nHer attendants bundle you ignominiously back up the staircase. Better luck next time, perhaps.
>>>	Name	Resisted

>>>	Description	Every love song has a potentially catastrophic effect on her condition. Yes, even if the lover is cold-hearted and strange.

"Make it stop, make it quiet!"

>>>	Description	It's difficult reading, because the best passages have been edited and in some places completely blacked out. There is a scene involving a blindfold and a bowl of Zzoup, but it keeps lapsing into ellipses. Some sentences would be more comprehensible if you replaced the word "spoon" with another word entirely.\r\n\r\nBut the flow of words does have a little modest effect on Rosina. The ice melts around her, and she tosses uncomfortably. "Make it stop, make it quiet!"

>>>	Description	You ask the onlookers directly. "Conflagrati," says one, and titters. Another one curiously puts her hand on your forehead, as though to see whether you have a fever. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't look as though any of them have gone sharp at all. What are they doing here?
>>>	Name	Carrion birds
>>>	Teaser	You put your question...
>>>	Description	You put your question. Rosina glances over at the cluster of men and women. Her expression is blank; the emotion that ought to be there has been controlled, or wiped away.\r\n\r\n"There are certain... idiotic... sects," she says. "People who want to suffer what I have. They follow me around, hoping to be infected by my conflagration."

>>>	Description	Descend into the Anthe chamber reserved for those who flourish at the spleen. The stone of the chamber is veined with red. Some members of the Venous Salon wear clothes that reveal the midriff, so that one can see the telltale points of the crystal form under their skin.\r\n\r\nIt is a party game here to take turns reading aloud offensive letters to the London newspapers, and insulting missives from home, and to compete at not caring in the least.

>>>	Description	When you have grown liver-sharp, you may take the left exit from the main chamber of Anthe and descend a staircase gritty underfoot. The Salon of Silver Salts is hung with small lights, and the inhabitants look ordinary. They are sipping arsenical teas and dining on poisonous toadstools.

The inhabitants take turns to hold up the part of the ceiling that is in danger of caving in. \r\n\r\n"I still don't recommend falling from a height," one of the old-timers is saying to a new member. "True, you won't break your bones. Now they'll break you. Tear right through your muscle and skin, and stick out! Ha! Unless you go the rest of the way and grow a sharp skin, but..." He shrugs.

The suicide of wasps on crystal Anthean skin is one of their primary sources of comedy. \r\n\r\nThese people have the most to do if they wish to conceal their condition from those above the Unterzee. They almost never leave Anthe, but if they do, they wrap themselves in bandages and pass as Tomb Colonists, or mask themselves like a native of Visage.

"I need to see what is in the ventral chamber."\r\n\r\nLater, back on your own ship, you consult her about her intentions. She looks bleak. "I am becoming involved," she confesses.

She spends two and a half hours alone in her surgery. Afterward, there is no warmth in her eyes when she looks at you, and she's missing a tooth. \r\n\r\n"I'm ready," she says.

>>>	Description	"It doesn't matter to me," she says at once. Then she's still a moment. Then she says, "Or... it shouldn't matter to me. The Cladery Heart is all I have of my mother, but I learned not to need her. Perhaps if I sold her to you, but remained on the crew... then it would be both mine and not-mine. That would be correct, I think." She is evidently pleased with the neatness of this scheme.

>>>	Description	She remembers Bourdain better than the others. "We were confidantes. He was a Frenchman and - in his day - a member of the revolutionaries' Calendar Council. He wrote pamphlets, and placed bombs. I could not say which were more incendiary." Her smile is fond.\r\n\r\n"If the worst came to the worst, he meant to hide in Frostfound. But the ice-spires swallowed him. Years ago I sent an agent to retrieve him, but their vessel was lost. Prey to pirates, I think. Or wreckers."
>>	Name	The Propagandist
>>	Description	This statue depicts an unassuming, bespectacled man with thinning hair and a solemn face. "Bourdain," Mariam remembers.
>>>	Teaser	She gropes for his name, for a moment...
>>>	Description	She gropes for his name, for a moment. "Lytton. He was more than our financier. He was our courage. He inspired us when we faltered."\r\n\r\nYou remind her that he wants no further part in the endeavour. "Yes. But he has told us who should replace him." She clicks open the locket. The face of the Fierce Philanthropist looks out.
>>	Name	The Financier
>>	Description	The statue has its hands folded at its waist. Its expression is determined, beatific. Mariam has hung Lytton's locket - which you gave her when you first met - around its neck. 
>>>	Teaser	Mariam examines the words she once carved on the statue's plinth...
>>>	Description	Mariam examines the words she once carved on the statue's plinth. "Yes. Rosina's cousin. He was one of the Presbyterate's border-guards: the Gracious. But they discharged him when he allowed an explorer access to the Interior. An explorer..." she taps her teeth, thinking. "Lorenzo? Afterwards, Batuk became a mercenary, and joined our number.\r\n\r\n"He'd had enough of discipline. He will have sought a place of freedom."
>>	Name	The Soldier
>>	Description	A well-built man in late middle-age. His head is bald. His beard is near.  "Batuk," Mariam says, pleased that she could remember. "I'm rather proud of this one."
>>>	Teaser	"I remember that he was the first I recruited to my scheme," Mariam says...
>>>	Description	"I remember that he was the first I recruited to my scheme," Mariam says. "He was a scion of the Taimen, injured in a battle against my homeland. I saved his life. My father was not pleased.\r\n\r\n"Arik seized the Polythremi vessels we needed to navigate the red river. He commanded our fleets. After our defeat, he planned to go to Hideaway. He said he had an idea."\r\n
>>	Name	The Captain
>>	Description	A wiry gentleman of the Khanate, his graven expression is unimpressed. "This is Arik," Mariam tells you. Engraved on his plinth are the words 'THE SECOND OF THE SEVEN'. 
>>>	Teaser	"Our healer, Rosina...
>>>	Description	"Our healer, Rosina. She was the abbess at the hospital in Adam's Way, and petitioned Nidah on several occasions to afford her patients additional time. The Nidaheen ignored her. I did not."\r\n\r\nMariam rubs her temples, struggling to remember. "She contracted a condition of her own. If she has survived, it will be because she has found somewhere calm, and clear, and hard."
>>	Name	The Healer
>>	Description	This statue is of a woman of advancing years. A daughter of the Presbyterate, clad in a priestess' robe.
>>>	Teaser	"To remind me what I was," she says...
>>>	Description	"To remind me what I was," she says. "Before the Fathomking changed me. Before I began to forget." She looks at the replica of herself, chewing her lip. "I look certain, don't I? Confident. I wonder if that was true, or if I made it up."
>>	Name	The Schemer
>>	Description	A statue of Mariam, clad not in a mason's apron but a royal gown. A knowing smile graces her black-bone lips. 
>>	Name	Identify replacements
>>	Description	Some of the Seven may be beyond your reach. Mariam can suggest likely replacements.
>	Teaser	Her skin is the exact black-blue of the bone walls...
>	Description	Her skin is the exact black-blue of the bone walls. She brushes dust from her apron. A small copper kettle steams on the floor at her feet, emitting an sharp, nutty odour.\r\n\r\nEvery surface in the chamber - a tessellation of cemented bone - is engraved. Amongst the threading scrawl, certain phrases repeat.\r\n\r\nREMEMBER THE WAX-WIND\r\nIT WILL FIND YOU\r\nI AM A CANDLE\r\nWIND WAX-WIND WAX-WIND WAX\r\n
>	Name	Mariam
>>>	Teaser	She listens as you describe your ambition...
>>>	Description	She listens as you describe your ambition. The locket turns, over and over, in her hands. Her eyes are dark, fathomless. When you are finished, something stirs in them.\r\n\r\n"Immortality - true immortality, without tricks or compromise - resides in Nidah. We can help you. Yes, we failed once. But failure hones. It hardens. Help me take Nidah and you'll have all the life you could ever live. But to get it, we must restore the Seven Against Nidah."

>>	Description	You have other business.
>>>	Teaser	She speaks hesitantly, following the memories like breadcrumbs...
>>>	Description	She speaks hesitantly, following the memories like breadcrumbs. "I was estranged from my father. He tried to win me back with a gift that wasn't his to give. I spurned it. I rebelled. I founded the Seven Against Nidah. I failed. I fled. I bargained. I hid here. I make statues, and try to remember." She presses one hand to her head, as if it could trap the thoughts within. 
>>	Name	Ask who she is
>>	Description	"I was..." she hesitates and turns to the wall, reading the writing there to refresh her memory. "Yes. I was the Presbyter's daughter." 
>>>	Teaser	"I can remember what my colleagues would have said: 'to live eternal', 'to undo the injustice of death'...
>>>	Description	"I can remember what my colleagues would have said: 'to live eternal', 'to undo the injustice of death'. But I was offered immortality and gave it away. I've never cared overly for the betterment of others." She thinks for a while. "Perhaps I just dislike smugness. The Presbyters are very, very smug."\r\n\r\nPart of the story, perhaps.
>>	Name	Ask why she opposes Nidah
>>	Description	She frowns. "I'm not sure I can remember. I must have written it down, somewhere."
>>	Name	Follow her to the Hall of Sevens
>>	Description	"Come, come. Lots to do." [Learn about the Seven, and how to find them.]
>>	Name	Offer Mariam intelligence

>>>	Teaser	Mariam leads you into the Hall of Sevens, where her statue has been smashed to pieces...
>>>	Description	Mariam leads you into the Hall of Sevens, where her statue has been smashed to pieces. A new statue completes the line of the assembled Seven: a dignified and well-observed - if slightly <i>too</i> honest - effigy of you.\r\n\r\n"The Seven need a new Schemer. It can't be me, can it? I'm stuck down here. Or what's left of me is." She taps, angrily, at her skull. "First thing's first," she fetches two brooms, and passes one to you. "Sweep." She begins to brush at the thick dust that covers the floor.\r\n\r\nYour initial application of the broom reveals a painting: a jagged curve of coastline. The next exposes a scattering of islands, somehow familiar: are they the Phosgene Bleaks? Meanwhile, Mariam's brush has uncovered a green and many-canalled land with the word 'HELL' written across it. The floor is a map; no - a game-board depicting the whole of the Neath. Thin black lines turn it into a grid, and finer lines divide the squares into a finer grid.\r\n\r\n"In the next room are statues of our enemies and complicating parties. The Gracious, the Replete, the Presbyter, the Admiralty, Mount Nomad, and so forth. I always found -" she breaks off to scrub at a resilient clot of bone-dust, "- that it was easier to plan from a bat's-eye perspective." [Plan your conquest of Nidah.]\r\n
>>	Name	Tell Mariam that six are assembled

>>>	Description	"I engineered wars between the sub-kingdoms of the Elder Continent, to distract the Presbyter's attention. I occupied our enemy's spies with intrigues. And I settled disagreements among the Seven, which naturally arose. We were idealists and opportunists; the stakes were high."
>>	Name	What was her role in the Seven?
>>	Description	"I gathered them. And once they were gathered, I became their Schemer."
>>>	Teaser	"As punishment for our attempt on their city, the Nidaheen promised me to the Wax-Wind...
>>>	Description	"As punishment for our attempt on their city, the Nidaheen promised me to the Wax-Wind. I sought sanctuary in the Fathomking's Hold, and made an arrangement with His Complexity. He changed me," she runs a finger down her peligin cheek. "I forget things, now, unless I write them down, or put faces to them."\r\n\r\n"Here among the other lost histories, I am hidden from the Presbyterate's agents and oracles. But were I to venture above the waves, the Wax-Wind would find me, and I'd end my days a candle."
>>	Name	Why is she here?
>>	Description	Her mouth twists in distaste.
>>>	Teaser	"The College of Mortality accords them eternal life...
>>>	Description	"The College of Mortality accords them eternal life. And when a Presbyter tires of the throne, or reigns a thousand years, they give up the title and join the College. Thus everything remains the same. The old Presters choose new ones, the new ones join the old."\r\n
>>	Name	What does she know of the Presbyter?

>	Description	"Nidah is a closed city, the guarded heart of the Presbyterate. We must cross the Elder Continent, destroy her numberless armies, and breach her basalt walls."\r\n\r\nMariam surveys the broad map of the Neath. "We have a lot of scheming to do, [q:Addressed As]." [Choose and pursue a method to overcome each of the three obstacles in your way: the armies of the Presbyterate, the way to Nidah, and the city's walls.]

>>>	Teaser	Mariam's eyes widen as you lay out the extent of your espionage network upon the map-board...
>>>	Description	Mariam's eyes widen as you lay out the extent of your espionage network upon the map-board. "A foothold on the Elder Continent!" She exclaims, and grins with her blue-black teeth. "You've planted the seed, [q:Addressed As]. Now, we nurture it; encourage it to grow like vines through the Prester's alliances. Then, in a number of years, we give the order - and the Presbyterate turns against itself." Mariam's memory is more reliable when she's scheming.\r\n\r\n"With a little luck, we will be able to take Nidah with a detachment of mercenaries; I think I know just the fellows..."
>>	Name	Defeat the Presbyter's armies: commit a spy network
>>	Description	The Presbyterate's military is a patchwork of feudal obligations and treaties agreed between its seventy-six sub-kingdoms. It is a knot, ready to be unpicked. [To unlock espionage options, if you haven't already, deliver Vital Intelligence to the Dark-Spectacled Admiral in London, then talk to the Voracious Diplomat.]
>>>	Teaser	Movements begin in small ways...
>>>	Description	Movements begin in small ways. Whispers in the bazaar; slogans daubed in alleyways. In this case, the words that spread are sacred - an order of the first Presbyter, written long ago in Nidah. "No man shall live a thousand years."\r\n\r\nWhen the people of the Elder Continent learn that their Presbyters don't die when they live to a thousand, but instead retire to the College of Mortality to advise the next ruler, they are incensed. The movement spreads slowly, the Mithridate Office - the Prester's own misinformers - working hard to stamp it out. \r\n\r\nYou keep it alive with the liberal application of money. The pebble is rolling, now. In a few years, you will lead the avalanche to Nidah.
>>>	Name	A rumble on the mountain
>>	Name	Defeat the Presbyter's armies: foster a popular uprising
>>	Description	Your Propagandist proposes it. "The Prester has vast wealth, unguessable power, and immortality. He is an easy man to resent." It will take time. More immediately, it will take a secret capable of toppling a government. And, inevitably, a great deal of money. 
>>>	Teaser	What does the living city want with fluke-cores?
>>>	Description	What does the living city want with fluke-cores? Its Hundred-Hearted King will not say. The crewman who delivered them reports carrying them to the white villa atop the hill, where countless statues waited with stony, avid eyes.\r\n\r\nIt will take years to construct the whole fleet, but when the first vessel slides gracefully into Batuk's hidden shoreside encampment, its oars sing a joyous hosannah. Their harmony is impeccable.
>>>	Name	The bargain
>>	Name	Secure the route to Nidah: procure a living fleet to traverse the red river
>>	Description	Your Soldier advocates the route the Seven took on their initial attempt against Nidah. It worked then; and will serve again. Unfortunately, Polythreme - the only source of the ships able to navigate the red river - demands an unusual price.
>>>	Teaser	Isery explains their plan...
>>>	Description	Isery explains their plan. "First, we must cross the Desert of Eyes, where eyes bloom in the sands. Their regard strips all pretence, reducing the traveller to a state of foetal self-loathing. Hence the sunlight: we will blind them.\r\n\r\n"Next is the Listening Desert, where earthquakes pursue the unwary. Thus, the primordial shrieks - I propose to deafen it. Perhaps you notice a theme?\r\n\r\n"Lastly, we would reach at the Desert of Delights. The touch of its sands is indescribably engrossing. Our best hope here is something equally as captivating, to divert us. The whole journey will undoubtedly be awful, but I believe it can be done." Isery taps a clawed finger-ring on one sharp cheek-bone. What they have described is only the beginning of it. Finding the route is one thing. Making it safe for your forces to follow is another, and will take years.
>>	Name	Secure the route to Nidah: plot a course across three deserts
>>	Description	To reach Nidah overland, you must cross three deserts, each more impossible than the last. Your Guide, however, believes a way can be made. They will need some unusual supplies.
>>>	Teaser	Arik's plan involves steering Temtum from the zee, across the Elder Continent, and using the beast as a siege engine...
>>>	Description	Arik's plan involves steering Temtum from the zee, across the Elder Continent, and using the beast as a siege engine. 'Temtum will topple the walls like meringue,' his report claims. He seems confident. But it will take a long period of gradual excursions for the great city-beast of Hideaway to build up a tolerance for life above the waves. Arik gets started immediately.
>>>	Name	Leviathan
>>	Name	Breaching Nidah's walls: deploy a leviathan from the depths of the zee
>>	Description	Arik has not been idle since the defeat of the Seven. He has tamed a monster of the deep zee, and presents you with a report on its deployment. [Advance the story on Hideaway and favour the Sprightly Visionary to unlock this option.]
>>>	Teaser	The test-site still glows...
>>>	Description	The test-site still glows. Heat hangs in the air like a blanket, crisping the hairs on the back of your hand. You remove your safety goggles (their lenses are warped beyond use now, anyway) and examine what used to be a monolith of basalt and is now a shapeless, seeping mass, hissing as it cools.\r\n\r\n"I rather think that will do," says your Financier, whose engineers are engaging in a hearty round of back-slapping. "We'll have to go into mass production, of course. It'll take time."
>>>	Name	Science!
>>	Name	Breaching Nidah's walls: invest in experimental munitions research
>>	Description	Cotterell & Hathersage have made great strides, recently, in the art of fulmination. If you could combine their chemistry with recent developments in blast-shaping and some terribly modern research into thermobaric expulsion, you could be onto something.

>	Description	The Cat's Chiefest Claw meets you in their suite with a distracted air and a raised eyebrow. \r\n\r\nYou raise the matter of the Well-Travelled Notary's memories. Isery taps clawed finger-rings on the stem of a wine glass; the sound is silvery and sharp. "I see someone's been talking. I'm reluctant: the notary only has a taste or two left in him. I was saving them for myself - this Nidah business... fascinating."

>>>	Description	Isery removes a jar from a teak cabinet, and a spoon of tarnished silver from a drawer. They set them on the desk before you. You scrape out the dregs of crimson honey - barely a spoonful. You lick it clean, and the memories take you.\r\n\r\nYou remember panic, disaster! Disassociated fragments of a wild flight. Heat - intolerable heat! You stumbled, and the gemmed flagstones burned your hands. You regained your feet. Behind you came the Host of Hyenas, fresh from the city of Caution, laughing as they slew.\r\n\r\nThrough the broken Persimmon Gate, still littered with corpses. The basalt walls at your back, now: black against the blazing shoulder of the Mountain. And how it blazed! Bright as the sun's skin! Only your goggles of smoked glass kept your eyes from boiling. \r\n\r\nYou remember the desperate journey back down the scarlet river, on living Polythremi ships that grieved for those left behind. A man leans on the rail: black shirt, a church dog-collar. Your employer, Lytton. He turns to look at you, and he is bereft. Off the port side, a ship expires from grief and sinks into the red, red waters.\r\n\r\nThe memories falter. You return to the Isle of Cats. Isery is there, reading. "Ah, you're back. Interesting, no? Someone tried to steal the Presbyterate's immortality. I'd say they were bold, but they failed, which makes them stupid. Still, they got close..."\r\n\r\nLytton: it is a name you've heard before. It belongs to a certain Fierce Philanthropist, who resides in Port Carnelian.

The Sisters chain you to a bed for your own safety. You can feel Isery crawling like a spider in your skull. Clawed finger-rings prick the stalk of your optic nerve.

The tigers of the Carnelian Coast might not be considered obvious candidates, but they are intimately familiar with the natural perils and resources of the Elder Continent.

But he remembers his debts. The footman returns with Madeira cake for you, and the carcass of one of the bristly pigs of the fungal jungle for His Highness.\r\n\r\nAs you eat, you note how his ears twitch with irritation, and how he growls at a bat that flits by the window. He is bored. You take your chance. The Prince stops eating to listen to your proposal. "Yes," he says, before you are done. "Yes; a thousand times yes. I will join your Seven, and war upon Nidah."\r\n\r\nThe taste of true princehood has whetted his appetite. Now he would be king.

"Here, my people are unwelcome in our own land. If I help you take Nidah, my price is this: a new kingdom on the bright slopes of the Mountain.

Bloodshed stains her gemstoned streets. This close, the light of the Mountain is savage. Lenses of sapphire protect your eyes as you march along the Avenue of Lament. At its end, beyond a statue of the first Presbyter, is the funereal facade of the College of Mortality. Grey. Grim. \r\n\r\nYour detachment has penetrated furthest into the city. Batuk is at your side, bearing the Seven's apple-and-ploughshare banner. "This is it," he bellows, over the sound of battle. "The last time, this is as far as we got." Your moment is at hand.\r\n

You retrieve his fallen banner, tie a length of red silk to it, and raise it high.\r\n \r\nAt your signal, your assassins strike at the remaining Seven. Your second-in-command curses and draws her pistol, pushing her way towards you. Fortunately, you identified her as one of Isery's agents several months ago. Your men, forewarned, fire first.\r\n\r\nYou give an order. Your gun emplacements begin methodically shelling the College of Mortality. Its mortuary-friezes vanish in clouds of dust. Holes are blasted in the walls, revealing glimpses of a facsimile-paradise: chambers of extravagant wealth; gardens of fruit-heavy trees; seraphically-beautiful servants, now shredded by shrapnel.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will repair it and make it your palace, when the once-Presbyters of the College surrender. Ah. There we are: a white flag. A rag of dusty bed sheet, but the most beautiful sight in the Neath. It means the city is yours. It means the Mountain is yours. It means eternal life is yours. And yours alone.

>>>	Description	With a cry, you charge, and in a short, bloody battle force your way into the College. Behind its mausoleum-grim walls, it is as close to a paradisiac afterlife as can be achieved. Ceilings aglow with stars, or azure with dazzling recreations of a summer's sky. Pools of cold crystal water. Servants of seraphic beauty.\r\n\r\nThe once-Presters fight back. Their vitality is impossible. Bullets do not kill them, nor swords. Your men stop fighting like soldiers and start fighting like butchers. Your victory is slow, but inevitable.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the College a vast door guards the way into the Mountain's heart. Your remaining soldiers drag it open, revealing a tunnel reaching into the Mountain's searing stone. Not even your sapphire goggles allow you to see within. A warm breeze spills out, carrying the scents of saffron, of lavender, of apples. \r\n\r\nBeyond lies the Garden, root of immortality. The rest of the Seven join you, and you enter as one. Your followers are close behind - part march, part procession, part festival. You lead them through the blazing light, whiter than a sun's heart. [This captain's career is complete.]

Your men, forewarned, fire first.\r\n\r\nThe troops loyal to you gather, and form a ring around the College of Mortality. You only need to hold out for a day. Then the Replete arrive, at the head of a glass-eyed army from Arbour. The remaining forces of the Seven are trapped, divided, and cut down.\r\n\r\nThe gate of the College opens. A once-Presbyter steps out. There is something familiar about his face - the high cheeks, the stern nose; so like Mariam's. He shakes your hand. "Seven and seventy kingdoms make up the Presbyterate," he tells you, unrolling a golden map. "Choose one."

>>>	Description	He leans forwards, the ice distorting his reflection, and opens his mouth. Is he trying to say something? There is no sound. He repeats the gesture. Does he mean-? You lean in and breathe on the ice, fogging it. Bourdain gives a minuscule smile. Then he raises a finger and begins to draw a message in the fog from the other side. \r\n\r\nHe writes backwards, which necessitates some deciphering. "I NEVER LEFT."\r\n\r\nIt is an awkward method of communication, but over the next few hours you manage to piece together his tale. Bourdain is relatively content with his current state. After the Seven's defeat, he attempted to hide in Frostfound. He failed at 'the Ruby Room', and this vestige was trapped in the ice. He has a number of agents in the Neath, though, and they are able to communicate with him via... you can't really follow that bit. Suffice it to say 'esoteric means'.\r\n\r\nIs he ready to resume the Seven's cause? He writes a final message in your breath. 'LIBERTY. EQUALITY. ETERNITY.'

This straight-backed, many-legged edifice is perhaps a chair. That oily surface - a table? An altar?\r\n\r\nThe breeze, winter-cold, enters through an arched window.

>>>	Description	The creature is towering, bulky, and unevenly-shaped beneath its fluttering veils. It carries what looks like a measuring rod, notched with unfamiliar enumerations. Its voice is shrill. "Welcome, Trespasser, to the House of Rods and Chains. Your daring is notable, and rare. My employer -" here, the thing extends what is hopefully an arm towards the window, and the sable, seething sun, "- would like you to deliver a message to the Neath.

One bowl holds a bubble of glass, in which something bright and misty coils. The other bowl is empty.

>>>	Description	"Please," the creature squeals, inclining its upper portions towards the scales. You take the glass bubble. The wisp inside it peers madly out with pinprick eyes. The black sun is closer, now, glaring into the chamber like a child through a dollhouse window.\r\n\r\nPain blooms behind your left temple. It migrates: across your cheek, down your neck, over your shoulder. You clutch at it, and feel a sliding, swelling pucker on your skin before it moves out of reach.\r\n\r\n"The Liberation of Night began long ago," the veiled creature pipes. "Tell whoever you choose, or do not. You are the message. Those who must know, will know." It bangs its measuring-rod on the floor. The sun screams in joy. Everything goes dark.\r\n\r\nYou find yourself back in your zubmarine, your crew desperately steering it away from the vast eye on the zee-bed. Your pain is easing, but not gone. You stumble wildly to your quarters. A mirror. You need a mirror!\r\n\r\n

Begone, then. My employer must grieve. To look on you longer would only cause it distress." Your vision floods with inky gloom.\r\n\r\nWhen it recedes you are back in your zubmarine, your crew frantically steering it away from the vast eye that dominates the zee-bed. You spring to help them

As he passes your brew, bellows of pain engulf the room, and all Hideaway trembles for a moment as the beast below writhes - but the Visionary doesn't spill a drop of the coffee.

In the centre of the room is a raised brass panel and a chair. The panel is covered in switches and gauges. '<i>Central control of Hideaway. Requires re-routing. I'll point the what/where.</i>' He hands you a pair of tweezers, and unscrews the back of the panel, exposing a mess of wire.\r\n\r\nThe operation itself is simple, if slow, but the results are immediate. The lights outside flicker, before shining brighter. Arik flips a switch; the ground shakes, and you're thrown left. He flips another; you're thrown right. Arik beams as he helps you steady yourself, and pats you on the back. '<i>Sorry for that - all's well, now. You've done a great service. Eternal thanks.</i>'

How did they hear of this so quickly? Do they have spies at the dock?\r\n\r\nHer smug smile disappears with the loud arrival of a gang of Chelonates, armed with heavy books.
